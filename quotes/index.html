Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.

Okay, asking somebody how long they believed in Santa Claus is so stupid, you can’t even consider the topic suitable for idle conversation. But if you still wanna know how long I believed in some old fat guy who wears a funky red suit, I can tell you this: I’ve never believed in him, ever. The Santa that showed up at my kindergarten Christmas festival, I knew he was fake. And I never saw mommy kissing Santa or anything. But I have to say, that even as a little kid, I knew better than to believe in some old man that only worked one day a year. Now, having said that, it wasn’t until I got older that I realized that aliens, time travelers, ghosts, monsters, espers, the evil syndicates and the anime/manga/fantasy flick heroes that fight said evil syndicates, were also fake. Okay, I guess I always knew those things were bogus, I just didn’t wanna admit it. All I ever wanted was for an alien, time traveler, ghost, monster, esper, evil syndicate, or the hero that fought them to just appear and say &#34;Hey&#34;. Unfortunately, reality is a hard road indeed. Yep, you gotta admit, the laws of physics definitely puts a damper on things. I even stopped watching those TV shows about aliens and ghosts and stuff. Aliens, time travelers, espers; of course they don’t exist, but a little part of me wishes that they did. I guess I’ve grown up and realized I can think about those things and still accept reality. But by the time I got out of junior high, I pretty much outgrew that kind of stuff and I guess I got used to the idea of living in an ordinary world. Just like that, I was in high school...that’s when I met her.

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

— “Now, I don’t know if you’re all aware of this, but Ghibli films... only air on NTV. Why is that? Can you tell us?”<br>— “We value friends, I guess. I don’t know if the term &#34;friends&#34; is appropriate, but at Ghibli we do value human relationships. It’s not about just working with market share leaders.” (Shinsuke Nonaka)<br>— “Here’s an extreme example. Only slightly exaggerated. Okuda became our NTV contact. Since then, for the 20 years or so that he’s worked with Ghibli, he has visited us every night.<br>Never talked about work. But we talked about lots of different things, which led to talking about family, naturally. That’s what gave birth to Spirited Away.<br>When Okuda’s daughter turned ten, Miyazaki had a cabin in the mountains, and he invited them there. So they spent some time there. That experience is what motivated Miyazaki to make Spirited Away.<br>I’ll say this, based on my experience. In your work, obviously, you’ll meet many people. But ultimately, it’s about who you work with. Only those who choose the right people to work with will be able to do the work they want.”

You know, sometimes I might think... about the world ending or something. I’d never say that to a child. This is important. Children are what keep me going. Not any particular child, children in general. In December, we bring out the goats. The kids remember them. When they’re gone, they notice. Kids really remember things, you see. Problems begin the moment we’re born. We’re born with infinite possibilities, only to give up on one after another. To choose one thing means to give up on another. That’s inevitable. But what can you do? That’s what it is to live.

— “You know, people who design airplanes and machines... No matter how much they believe that what they do is good, the winds of time eventually turn them into tools of industrial civilization. It’s never unscathed. They’re cursed dreams. Animation, too.”<br>— “Cursed dreams?” (Mami Sunada)<br>— “Today, all of humanity’s dreams are cursed somehow. Beautiful yet cursed dreams. I’m not even talking about wanting to be rich or famous. Screw that. That’s just hopeless. What I mean is, how do we know movies are even worthwhile? If you really think about it, is this not just some grand hobby? Maybe there was a time when you could make films that mattered, but now? Most of our world is rubbish. It’s difficult.”

I was taking a nap tonight around six and somewhere deep down in the dream I was in, it hit me — “I was dreaming.” I felt my unconscious body laying and the mind actively burning calories and sugar giving me this more-vivid-than-life moving picture. I consciously decided to wake myself up by scaring myself with the most profound abstract sensation of fear I could think of. The wake didn’t come. Just for a moment, I was stuck in the nightmare of my own making. In that fleeting blip, I thought to myself, “Is this what Hell is?” The kingdom of self-made fears locked up with a key that was never to be found. It is up to you to make escape but it is never guaranteed.

It’s raining, MY GOD I love rain. I woke up today and felt this gloomy and more melancholic vibe in the air. My bedroom is darker than usual. It’s chillier than usual. The air smells like pure bliss. Time goes slower. Tiny notes of romance are floating in the aura around. They’re so subtle that be sure to feel them through or you’ll miss out. What a weather, what a morning. What a day! Did I tell you it’s also going to rain for the rest of the day? It will! I love this. I love this. Thank you.

I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding— certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.

And they lived with it, and on it, and under it, and inside it, for it was all they had – first they saved up all their atoms, then they put them all together, and if one didn’t fit, why they chipped at it a bit, and everything was just fine ...

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For some reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore, the non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that he may have &#34;lost&#34;.  After all, any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds, win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.

There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as he entered, the man told the guard at the door: &#34;I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.&#34; This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.

When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes, but nothing was to be found.

<p>
On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the guard, saying: &#34;I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even better.&#34; So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.
</p>

On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his curiosity no longer. &#34;Sir Thief,&#34; he said, &#34;I am so perplexed, I cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?&#34;

&#34;Technique?&#34; said the programmer, turning from his terminal, &#34;What I follow is Tao – beyond all techniques! When I first began to program, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years, I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off.&#34;

The party of the first part shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate the party of the second part in a counter-clockwise direction, this point being tendered non-negotiable.  Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part becomes fully detached from the receptacle, the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part in a manner consistent with all relevant and applicable local, state and federal statutes. Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part shall have the option of beginning installation.  Aforesaid installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable. The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part, by any or all agents authorized by him, the objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the Partnership.

Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out.

In all the known history of Mankind, advances have been made primarily in physical technology; in the capacity of handling the inanimate world about Man. Control of self and society has been left to to chance or to the vague gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and emotion. As a result no culture of greater stability than about fifty-five percent has ever existed, and these only as the result of great human misery.
