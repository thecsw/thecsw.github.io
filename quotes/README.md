My randomness
=============

-   You know what I miracle it is to wake up? You can go to sleep and
    never wake up. It happens pretty often. So when you wake up and feel
    the sunshine on your eyelids, be grateful that you get to experience
    this beatiful world at least one more time. -- Me to my roommate on
    a Friday morning
-   There are only two skills worth developing, empathy and faith.
    Empathy to support others and faith to support yourself.
-   It\'s hard to explain, except by example, but it works. Things just
    happen in the right way, at the right time. At least they do when
    you let them, when you work with circumstances instead of saying,
    \"This isn\'t supposed to be happening this way,\" and trying hard
    to make it happen some other way. If you\'re in tune with The Way
    Things Work, then they work the way they need to, no matter what you
    may think about it at the time. -- *The Tao of Pooh*
-   *What day is it?*, asked Pooh. *Why, it\'s Today!*, squeaked Piglet.
    *My favorite day*, said Pooh.
-   An Empty sort of mind is valuable for finding pearls and tails and
    things because it can see what\'s in front of it. An Overstuffed
    mind is unable to. While the Clear mind listens to a bird singing,
    the Stuffed-Full-of-Knowledge-and-Cleverness mind wonders what kind
    of bird is singing. The more Stuffed Up it is, the less it can hear
    through its own ears and see through its own eyes.
