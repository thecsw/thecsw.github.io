Я видел пьяниц с мудрыми глазами

И падших женщин с ликом чистоты.

Я знаю сильных, что взахлёб рыдали

И слабых, что несут кресты.

Не бойся вора в нищенском обличьи,

И проклинать за мелочь, не спеши-

Ты бойся тех, кто выглядит прилично,

Вор с праведным лицом уносит часть души.

Не обвиняй во всех грехах соседа,

Интриг не строй и сплетен не плети!

Воздастся добротой тебе за это,

Когда споткнёшься на своём пути.

Не осуждай за то, в чём не уверен;

Не обещай, если решил солгать.

Не проверяй, когда уже доверил!

И не дари, планируя отнять.

A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day. The master noted
the novice\'s preoccupation with a hand-held computer game. \"Excuse
me\", he said, \"may I examine it?\"

The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master. \"I
see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,
and Hard\", said the master. \"Yet every such device has another level
of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be
conquered by the human.\"

\"Pray, great master,\" implored the novice, \"how does one find this
mysterious setting?\"

The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under foot.
And suddenly the novice was enlightened.

You\'re the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasy

The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the
subject of towels.

Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some
reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of
a toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.
Furthermore, the non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker
any of these or a dozen other items that he may have \"lost\". After
all, any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy,
struggle against terrible odds, win through and still know where his
towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.

There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as he
entered, the man told the guard at the door: \"I am a great thief,
renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for this trade show
shall not escape unplundered.\" This speech disturbed the guard greatly,
because there were millions of dollars of computer equipment inside, so
he watched the man carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to
booth, humming quietly to himself.

When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,
but nothing was to be found.

On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the
guard, saying: \"I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will
be even better.\" So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no
avail.

On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his
curiosity no longer. \"Sir Thief,\" he said, \"I am so perplexed, I
cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are
stealing?\"

The man smiled. \"I am stealing ideas,\" he said.

Prince Wang\'s programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon
the keyboard. The program compiled without and error message, and the
program ran like a gentle wind.

\"Excellent!\" the Prince exclaimed. \"Your technique is faultless!\"

\"Technique?\" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, \"What I
follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program, I
would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years, I
no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see
nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle.
My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In
short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult
problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I
change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of
idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of
the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off.\"

Prince Wang said, \"Would that all of my programmers were as wise!\"

Q: How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?

A: Whereas the party of the first part, also known as \"Lawyer\", and
the party of the second part, also known as \"Light Bulb\", do hereby
and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second
part shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure
to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e., the lighting,
elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the
front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just
inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the
carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of
the second part and not required by the aforementioned agreement between
the parties.

The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
to, the following. The party of the first part shall, with or without
elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any
other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate
the party of the second part in a counter-clockwise direction, this
point being tendered non-negotiable. Upon reaching a point where the
party of the second part becomes fully detached from the receptacle, the
party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party
of the second part in a manner consistent with all relevant and
applicable local, state and federal statutes. Once separation and
disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part shall have the
option of beginning installation. Aforesaid installation shall occur in
a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step
one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation
should occur in a clockwise direction, this point also being
non-negotiable. The above described steps may be performed, at the
option of the party of the first part, by any or all agents authorized
by him, the objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the
Partnership.

Ours \[i.e., the Christian religion\] is assuredly the most ridiculous,
the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected
this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by
extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble,
who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke;
I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to
think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble
enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can
point out.

In all the known history of Mankind, advances have been made primarily
in physical technology; in the capacity of handling the inanimate world
about Man. Control of self and society has been left to to chance or to
the vague gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and
emotion. As a result no culture of greater stability than about
fifty-five percent has ever existed, and these only as the result of
great human misery.
