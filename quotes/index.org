* My randomness

- You know what I miracle it is to wake up? You can go to sleep and never wake
  up. It happens pretty often. So when you wake up and feel the sunshine on your
  eyelids, be grateful that you get to experience this beatiful world at least
  one more time. -- Me to my roommate on a Friday morning
- There are only two skills worth developing, empathy and faith. Empathy to
  support others and faith to support yourself.
