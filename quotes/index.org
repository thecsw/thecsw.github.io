  It is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three benefits:
  freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either.
  -- Mark Twain

  C++ is history repeated as tragedy. Java is history repeated as farce. – Scott
  McKay

# - You know what I miracle it is to wake up? You can go to sleep and never wake
#   up. It happens pretty often. So when you wake up and feel the sunshine on your
#   eyelids, be grateful that you get to experience this beatiful world at least
#   one more time. -- Me to my roommate on a Friday morning
# - There are only two skills worth developing, empathy and faith. Empathy to
#   support others and faith to support yourself.
# - It's hard to explain, except by example, but it works. Things just happen in
#   the right way, at the right time. At least they do when you let them, when you
#   work with circumstances instead of saying, "This isn't supposed to be
#   happening this way," and trying hard  to make it happen some other way. If
#   you're in tune with The Way Things Work, then they work the way they need to,
#   no matter what you may think about it at the time. -- /The Tao of Pooh/
# - /What day is it?/, asked Pooh. /Why, it's Today!/, squeaked Piglet. /My
#   favorite day/, said Pooh.
# - An Empty sort of mind is valuable for finding pearls and tails and things
#   because it can see what's in front of it. An Overstuffed mind is unable
#   to. While the Clear mind listens to a bird singing, the
#   Stuffed-Full-of-Knowledge-and-Cleverness mind wonders what kind of bird is
#   singing. The more Stuffed Up it is, the less it can hear through its own ears
#   and see through its own eyes.
# - My destination everywhere is nowhere.
# - Life is too short to write C++ programs
