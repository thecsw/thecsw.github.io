    Religion is like a blind man looking in a black room for a black cat that
    isn't there, and finding it. 

    ‚Äî Oscar Wilde

*** 213; 12020 H.E.

    In all the known history of Mankind, advances have been made primarily in
    physical technology; in the capacity of handling the inanimate world about 
    Man. Control of self and society has been left to to chance or to the vague 
    gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and emotion. As a 
    result no culture of greater stability than about fifty-five percent has
    ever existed, and these only as the result of great human misery.

    Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their

    The galaxies hum the shape and form in their essence. That is their secret.

    The particles whisper of the nature of proper interactions. That is their
    game.

    And during a storm, in the forest, on the right night, it is no secret that
    the leaves all sing of God.
