There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamored of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those who minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black, fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of the birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleeper, and yet must needs call forth Sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin, dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colors of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colors, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of pleasure their pain.

‚Äï Oscar Wilde, /The Picture of Dorian Gray/

** 330; 12023 H.E.

``There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is
immoral-immoral from the scientific point of view.''\
``Why?''\
``Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think
his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not
real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He
becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been
written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature
perfectly‚Äîthat is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves
nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes
to one's self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry and cloth the
beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our
race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis
of morals; the terror of God, which is the secret of religion‚Äîthese are the two
things that govern us. And yet‚Äî''\
``And yet," continues Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice,"I believe that if
one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to
every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream‚ÄîI believe
that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all
the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal‚Äîto something
finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man among us
is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in
the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every
impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body
sins once, and has done with its sins, for action is a mode of
purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the
luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to
it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has
forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous
and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in
the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the
world take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and
your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,
thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose
mere memory might stain your cheek with shame‚Äî''\
``Stop!'' faltered Dorian Gray, ``stop! you bewilder me. I don't know what to
say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don't speak. Let me
think, or, rather, let me try not to think.''

Okay, asking somebody how long they believed in Santa Claus is so stupid, you
can't even consider the topic suitable for idle conversation. But if you still
wanna know how long I believed in some old fat guy who wears a funky red suit, I
can tell you this: I've never believed in him, ever. The Santa that showed up at
my kindergarten Christmas festival, I knew he was fake. And I never saw mommy
kissing Santa or anything. But I have to say, that even as a little kid, I knew
better than to believe in some old man that only worked one day a year. Now,
having said that, it wasn't until I got older that I realized that aliens, time
travelers, ghosts, monsters, espers, the evil syndicates and the
anime/manga/fantasy flick heroes that fight said evil syndicates, were also
fake. Okay, I guess I always knew those things were bogus, I just didn't wanna
admit it. All I ever wanted was for an alien, time traveler, ghost, monster,
esper, evil syndicate, or the hero that fought them to just appear and say
"Hey". Unfortunately, reality is a hard road indeed. Yep, you gotta admit, the
laws of physics definitely puts a damper on things. I even stopped watching
those TV shows about aliens and ghosts and stuff. Aliens, time travelers,
espers; of course they don't exist, but a little part of me wishes that they
did. I guess I've grown up and realized I can think about those things and still
accept reality. But by the time I got out of junior high, I pretty much outgrew
that kind of stuff and I guess I got used to the idea of living in an ordinary
world. Just like that, I was in high school...that's when I met her.

So they spent some time there.

Miyazaki to make Spirited Away.\

Not far from here, by a white sun, behind a green star, lived the
Steelypips, illustrious, industrious, and they hadn't a care: no spats in
their vats, no rules, no schools, no gloom, no evil influence of the
moon, no trouble from matter or antimatter -- for they had a machine, a
dream of a machine, with springs and gears and perfect in every respect.
And they lived with it, and on it, and under it, and inside it, for it
was all they had -- first they saved up all their atoms, then they put
them all together, and if one didn't fit, why they chipped at it a bit,
and everything was just fine ...

A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day.  The master
noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.  "Excuse me",
he said, "may I examine it?"

The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master.
"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,
and Hard", said the master.  "Yet every such device has another level of play,
where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the
human."

"Pray, great master," implored the novice, "how does one find this
mysterious setting?"
 
The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under foot.
And suddenly the novice was enlightened.

 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on
the subject of towels.

 Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For
some reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a
toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore,
the non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or
a dozen other items that he may have "lost".  After all, any man who can
hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds,
win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be
reckoned with.

There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as he entered, the man told the guard at the door:
"I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."
This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.

When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes, but nothing was to be found.

On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the guard, saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even better." So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.

On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his curiosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?"

The man smiled. "I am stealing ideas," he said.

Prince Wang's programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon the keyboard. The program compiled without and error message, and the program ran like a gentle wind.

"Excellent!" the Prince exclaimed. "Your technique is faultless!"

"Technique?" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, "What I follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years, I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off."

Prince Wang said, "Would that all of my programmers were as wise!"

Q:  How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?

A:  Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "Lawyer", and the
party of the second part, also known as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith
agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part shall be removed
from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed
upon duties, i.e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of
the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating
at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of
the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the
second part and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the
parties.\
The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be
limited to, the following.  The party of the first part shall, with or without
elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other
means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate the party
of the second part in a counter-clockwise direction, this point being tendered
non-negotiable.  Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part
becomes fully detached from the receptacle, the party of the first part shall
have the option of disposing of the party of the second part in a manner
consistent with all relevant and applicable local, state and federal statutes.
Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part
shall have the option of beginning installation.  Aforesaid installation shall
occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in
step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation
should occur in a clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable.
The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the
first part, by any or all agents authorized by him, the objective being to
produce the most possible revenue for the Partnership.
