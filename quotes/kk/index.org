 "I asked him if he could turn off one of the lights, the glare on the white walls was making me drowsy. He said he couldn't. That was how they'd been wired. It was all or nothing."

Do not go gentle into that good night,\
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,\
Because their words had forked no lightning they\
Do not go gentle into that good night.\

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright\
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\
Do not go gentle into that good night.\

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\

And you, my father, there on the sad height,\
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\
Do not go gentle into that good night.\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\

an old envelope some years ago, even with it being left undated the memory of
where it was written still remains in the rooms of her mind. 
One of the largest thunderstorms she'd ever witnessed happened days later on
that trip.

 *stranger:* You believe... that there are people out there... People like us.

*marin*  I don't know about people. And I doubt they're like us. But maybe some kind of lighter, more luminous beings, less burdened... (Looking up at her, in a different tone)  When I first saw you tonight, walking into that smoky train station ‚Äì so bright, so clear, shining ‚Äì for a moment I thought that you came from another world.


*stranger*  Perhaps I am from another world.


*marin* No... no...


*stranger*  How do you know?


*marin*  Because no star deviates from its path, no star stops in it's journey.


*stranger* I am the star that stopped.

 "When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there; for there is no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than then. Who has put me here? By whose order and direction have this place and time been allotted to me?" ‚ÄìBlaise Pascal
