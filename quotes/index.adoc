It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you

looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being
alive.

Q: How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?

A: Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "Lawyer", and the
party of the second part, also known as "Light Bulb", do hereby and
forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part
shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to
perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e., the lighting, elucidation,
and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (north)
door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just inside the
primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any
spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second
part and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the
parties.

The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
to, the following. The party of the first part shall, with or without
elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any
other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate
the party of the second part in a counter-clockwise direction, this
point being tendered non-negotiable. Upon reaching a point where the
party of the second part becomes fully detached from the receptacle, the
party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party
of the second part in a manner consistent with all relevant and
applicable local, state and federal statutes. Once separation and
disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part shall have the
option of beginning installation. Aforesaid installation shall occur in
a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step
one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation
should occur in a clockwise direction, this point also being
non-negotiable. The above described steps may be performed, at the
option of the party of the first part, by any or all agents authorized
by him, the objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the
Partnership.

‚Äî Akira Kurosawa

== 280; 12020 H.E.

Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous,
the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected
this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by
extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble,
who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke;
I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to
think. ‚Ä¶ My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble
enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can
point out.

‚Äî Oscar Wilde

== 213; 12020 H.E.

In all the known history of Mankind, advances have been made primarily
in physical technology; in the capacity of handling the inanimate world
about Man. Control of self and society has been left to to chance or to
the vague gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and
emotion. As a result no culture of greater stability than about
fifty-five percent has ever existed, and these only as the result of
great human misery.

And during a storm, in the forest, on the right night, it is no secret
that the leaves all sing of God.

It is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three

use either. ‚Äì Mark Twain
