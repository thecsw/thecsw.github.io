== Welcome to my website! 🌷

=== Introduction 🛀

*Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website* - _circa 2007_

I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my
home on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes,
webpage updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like
http://burger.com[burger.com] and http://fmboschetto.it[fmboschetto.it].
Maybe more people will try to have their own website that allows them to
modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!

=== My cozy blog 💻

Here is a list of my articles I have online. I hope you will find some
of them interesting and you can learn something new! Always learn

=== My favorite movies 🎥

I love movies and I think movies deserve a separate full section on my
website. Well, I have taken a Film class my freshman year and I loved
it. It was a class about trash movies. Talk to me about that! Alright,
here is the list:

* The Godfather
* The Godfather Part II
* 2001: A Space Odyssey
* The Big Lebowski

=== My favorite shows & soaps 📺🧼

Shows can even have more of a profound effect than movies. Watching a
good show and its experience can even be aphrodisiacal:

* Pride and Prejudice (1995 by BBC1)
* Twin Peaks
* New Girl
* House
* Louie
* Boston Legal

=== My favorite books 📚

Reading makes me sleepy, but here are some that give me good dreams:

* Anna Karenina
* Solaris
* The Tao of Pooh
* A Doll's House
* Foundation series

=== This Website 🌐

I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
articles and papers using the following list of tools: `LaTeX`, `groff`,
`markdown`, `Org-Mode`, `asciidoctor`, `HTML`, `plain text`. I had to
decompress Word files and wrestle with raw XML files there, what a trip
that was.

This beautiful website typed in https://orgmode.org/[Org-Mode] and built
using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]. The source code is
https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io[here].

It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
Kernighan:

* https://www.gopl.io/[The GO Programming Language]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language[C Programming
Language, 2nd Edition]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment[The
Unix Programming Environment]

=== Good stuff 💃💃💃
