== Welcome to my website! 🌷

=== Introduction 🛀

*Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website* - _circa 2007_

I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my
home on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes,
webpage updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
website. There is something very profound about Web 1.0, like
http://burger.com[burger.com] and http://fmboschetto.it[fmboschetto.it].
Maybe more people will try to have their own website that allows them to
modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!

I have a page where you can learn more link:./aboutme[about me 🤔]

TIP: Scroll to the bottom for details on how this website is built.

=== My cozy blog 💻

Here is a list of my articles I have online. I hope you will find some
of them interesting and you can learn something new! Always learn
something new!

=== My type stuff 📰

This is a list of some articles, essays, reports and presentations I
have made for purposes other than publishing online. Most of them (if
not all) should be in a PDF format, typed in LaTeX, Org-Mode, or
troff/groff. I hope you find them interesting!

=== My quotes ☁️

I have some of my favorite quotes and sayings recorded. Some of them are
mine. link:./quotes[The page is here!]

=== My favorite movies 🎥

I love movies and I think movies deserve a separate full section on my
website. Well, I have taken a Film class my freshman year and I loved
it. It was a class about trash movies. Talk to me about that! Alright,
here is the list:

* The Godfather
* The Godfather Part II
* 2001: A Space Odyssey
* The Big Lebowski

=== My favorite tv shows 📺

Shows can even have more of a profound effect than movies. Watching a
good show and its experience can even be aphrodisiacal:

* Pride and Prejudice (1995 by BBC1)
* Twin Peaks
* New Girl

=== My favorite books 📚

Reading makes me sleepy, but here are some that give me good dreams:

* Anna Karenina
* Solaris
* The Tao of Pooh
* A Doll's House

=== This Website 🌐

I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
articles and papers using the following list of tools: `LaTeX`, `groff`,
`markdown`, `Org-Mode`, `asciidoctor`, `HTML`, `plain text`. I had to
uncompress Word files and work with raw XML files there, what a trip
that was.

This beautiful website typed in https://orgmode.org/[Org-Mode] and built
using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]. The source code can be found
https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io[here].

It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
Kernighan:
