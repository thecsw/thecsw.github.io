## Welcome to my website!

### About me

My name is Sagindyk, everybody just calls me Sandy.
Currently, I am a Computer Science undergraduate student
at https://ku.edu[University of Kansas]. I am a huge
fan of `*UNIX*` philosophy and +Linux+ tools in general.
Wield the power of the terminal with `awk`, `sed`, and `grep`!
I have interests in cyber-security, DevOps, Software Development,
System Automation, Data Science, and Typesetting tools.

I am the creator and founder of
https://reddit.com/u/MemeInvestor_bot[Meme Investor Bot] -
the biggest interactive reddit bot on the platform that
allows users from all over to world to invest in memes
and collaborate together around their favorite content!
Almost a year after the initial launch, more than 20
developers and ethusiasts worked together towards making
a better platform for collaborative content creation and
promotion. We have more than 85 thousand registered users
on our system. We have our https://meme.market[website]
where we keep all the statistics updated and available
with the current trends, popular content, and meme markets!
I am the main maintainer of the project. Feel free to check
out our
https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot[github page]
and commit new changes!

I am also the creator of other various projects and bots,
such as https://reddit.com/u/prequelmemes_bot[u/PrequelMemes_bot],
https://reddit.com/u/HiveWriting_bot[u/HiveWriting_bot],
https://reddit.com/u/MemePolice_bot[u/MemePolice_bot], and so much more!

### This Website

I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
articles and papers using the following list of tools: `LaTeX`, `groff`,
`markdown`, `Org-Mode`, `asciidoctor`, `HTML`, `plain text`. I had to uncompress
Word files and work with raw XML files there, what a trip that was.

This beautiful website is built using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]

``` shell
find . -type f | grep '\.adoc$' | xargs asciidoctor
```

It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
Kernighan:
