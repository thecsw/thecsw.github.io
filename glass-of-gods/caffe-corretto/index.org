* Caffè corretto ☕️

{{{pics(caffe-corretto.jpg)}}}

Not only is this the ``corrected'' way to drink espresso, but the true and only
way I want to drink it from now on. Having its roots from some time of the early
1920s---there is no better way to feel like a working class Italian of that time
having a lunch break before getting back to work with the slight buzz of the
infamous grappa.

- Espresso shot
- 1/2 ounces of grappa

We like having it on the side, /ammazzacaffè/ style, where if desired, you can
ratio and correct the coffee with small and gentle drips and then pours of
grappa. Wikipedia says,

#+begin_quote
It is also known (outside Italy) as an espresso corretto. It is ordered as un
caffè corretto /alla grappa, ... alla sambuca, ... al cognac, or corretto di
Spadino/, depending on the desired liquor.

I'll have to try it!
