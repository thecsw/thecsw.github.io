K.K. likes her martini extra dirty. When I say extra dirty, I mean /extra/
*dirty*. Her tastes fluctuate as making an extra dirty Upside-Down martini---it
would be too briney and taste like soup---bear in mind, she likes it but
sometimes it even too could be too much.

After trying out a series of flavors spanning several months filled with the art
of deduction, experimenting, playing with a variety of ingredients---I like to
think we found something of value here.

- 1 1/2 oz of /Suntory Roku 6/ gin (/Fords/ gin would also do)
- 1 oz of /Noilly Prat/ Extra Dry Vermouth
- 3/4 oz of /Dirty Sue/ olive brine (from the jar of olives)
- 3 /Dirty Sue/ olives for garnish

Shake all the ingredients well (except garnish) and strain into a chilled
cocktail glass. Garnish with all three olives on a stick on top of the glass.

Enjoy.
