* Sazerac üçä

{{{pics(sazerac.jpg)}}}

iPhones are so bad in low-light shooting that the all kinds of chroma and luma
noise get so bad to the point that I simply cannot edit them in any shape of
form that could be presentable to the public. Especially since I also like the
look of 50mm lens by having all my pictures taken in 2x mode---the actual canvas
turns out to be a random sample of pixels each with a random color of your
choosing. BLARGH.

But whatever. Here is a /Sazerac/! I've always thought of it as America's first
cocktail, where combining any (by that time) nasty base spirit with its super
harsh bite with some sugar and bitters would have the world go round and society
functioning for one more day. Most of the liquor we have today got modernized and
mechanized to extents that we might never know what the spirits actually tasted
back in the day, but we can make a pretty good guess by the amount of sugar that
needed to counteract it.

- 2 dashes of absinthe (I used /Pernod/)
- 1 sugar cube
- 3 dashes of /Peychaud's Bitters/ (more on that)
- 2 ounces of /Old Forester 100 Proof Rye Whiskey/
- 1 nicely cut lemon peel

The traditional way would be to use two old-fashioned glasses, but I'll stick to
my trusty mixing glass. Rinse your old-fashioned glass with absinthe or in my
case, /Pernod/ and discard any excess liquid. I have absinthe in the pipeline, but
I always forget to strain it---it might be super bitter, I'll have to check up
on it later. Then in a mixing glass muddle the sugar with
bitters. Unfortunately, /Peychaud's/ has red#40 that gives it that extra red
color. Such a shame, since none of these concoctions used artificial coloring
back in the day. Instead, in one of my local bars, I have actually found a
credible replacement that is New Orleans Style by /All the Bitter/. It's
alcohol-free, but the closest one I could find that could match the flavor, even
though nothing really comes close to a genuine /Peychaud's/.

As the bitters and sugars have become one---as much as that is possible---pour
in the rye---the OG version would call for a cognac, which would make sense
because of the floral profile, but I like the higher proof /Old Forester/ I have
thta wouldn't drown in bitters and sugars. Fill the mixing glas with ice and
stir for a 20-25 seconds until chilled. Strain into the absinthe-rinsed glass
with a /julep/ strainer. Express a lemon peel over the glass and decorate it so it
looks real nice---I only had flesh grapefruits, which also worked out well!

Please enjoy this proto cocktail!
