What a simple and delightful scotch sour with a [[https://drunkardsalmanac.com/mark-twain-cocktail/][nice history]] behind it.

- 1 1/2 oz of /Dewar's ``White Label''/ blended scotch whiskey
- 3/4 oz of simple syrup
- 3/4 oz of fresh lemon juice
- 2-3 dashes of /Angostura/ bitters

I like the absence of an emulsified egg white or a cocktail foam, which gives it
a cleaner look. /K.K./ liked it without the bitters more, whereas I enjoy it with a
bit of the familiar herbal touch.

There is a dozen of [[https://sandyuraz.com/fortunes/][Mark Twain quote]]s on the website, here is one that I read
recently,
