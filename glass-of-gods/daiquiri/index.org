* Simple Daiquiri üçã‚Äçüü©

{{{pics(daiquiri.webp)}}}

Back to basics! When there is nothing around but a trusty rum, some lime and
sugar---what are you gonna do? We could make this Hemingway style with double
the rum and no sugar---but I thought of doing a classic to recall on how simple
the greatest ways are.

- 2 ounces of /Bacardi Superior/ rum
- 3/4 ounces of simple syrup
- 3/4 ounces of freshly squeezed lime juice

Shake well with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass---clean and yummy.

/Enjoy./
