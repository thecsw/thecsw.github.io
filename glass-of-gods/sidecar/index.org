I simply love it. Something about it. I always had a soft spot for cognacs,
since my parents are Hennessy believers. With my lower than regular sugar levels,
I like all stuff sour and tart. Can't go wrong with this.

- 1 1/2 ounces of /Courvoisier VS/ cognac (from the freezer)
- 1 ounce of /Cointreau/
- 3/4 ounces of fresh lemon juice

Shake well and strain into a /Nick & Nora/ glass. *Voila.* It will drive itself
towards the person you're most fond of.

/Enjoy./
