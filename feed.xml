      <description>They had no reason to cook this hard. I believe this must have been a sting operation of some sort, since when I found out about this show, nobody was talking about it and even the most hardcore anime-watching-following-all-seasons friends I have, nobody had heard of this Chinese show. Only seeing the original trailer of the show had ignited our curiosity from nil to over elevent in a few moments‚Äô time that we called everybody for an emergency council meeting, every two weeks, where we would sit down a...

      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/feelings</link>
      <description>I can‚Äôt seem to feel when I want to feel so desperately. When I must feel, why do I not have that sensation? There is something to be said of not being overly emotional or letting the fleeting sensations of the moment control the mind, but there is an equally strong argument to be made in favor of following those gusts of inspiration, as they often lead to places and times that are locked to anyone with a mind that is too literal and rational. Where does the carelessness stop and indiffere... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <title>(Film) One Battle After Another</title>
      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/drama/one-battle-after-another</link>
      <description>This is an epic tale of love, betrayal, loss, loyalty, mission, and consequences that come with each. The sheer scale of the story told is one to behold. From the moment it started, on a sensitive topic of today‚Äîit had not let me go from its tight grip not even for a moment‚Äôs time. The music, the cinematography, the separation of the events to the ‚Äúdangerous fast-moving past, almost a glimpse into who they used to be‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthe aftermath of being domestic terrorists and meeting the wrath of militarized violence.‚Äù I‚Äôm impressed by the ide...

      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/drama/minecraft</link>
      <description>Minecraft Movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. It‚Äôs just straight-up bad, man. I studied films in college, took classes, even did a whole graduate-level course on trash films like Asylum, John Waters, Sharknado, etc., but they all had a charm to eat‚Äîthey were campy, they had something to say, they tried so desperately to be something that they weren‚Äôt resulting in a product that genuine. Minecraft Movie is the polar opposite of it all, as it lacks any kind of substance, soul, purpose,... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>My first memory of seeing this film comes from college, when my mother recommended me see this tale of Nicolas Cage finding out the life he had almost grasped but had let go of with a decision that nobody can really fault him for. The clips and the general inspiration for the film has been living rent-free in my mind since then. As corny as it sounds, but that contrast of Nicolas Cage achieving everything that a mere mortal could, he had only realized how impoverished his life was when he saw the much boring but much more fulfilling glimpse i...

      <description>I remember growing up next to shelves filled with books of all widths and genres. My parents gave me the taste of collecting books such that one day, when their time comes, someone will read them. It kick-started my love for literature and where I am now. In 2016, while I was living in Armenia, I went to a small (literal hole in the wall) indie bookstore in one of their underground malls near the mai... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>While watching The Be Hero X this Tuesday night, the boys had a healthy dose of four negronis, which prompted us to indulge ourselves in three dinners. It being one of the most frequently ordered cocktails in the world, if not topping the charts‚Äîit‚Äôs really easy to see why. Incredibly inoffensive, tasty, and straight-forward to make with any ingredients resembling the Big Three. I like to think the recent Mads Mikkelsen ad for Campari helped the g...

      <description>It would be hard to imagine a movie that is more formulaic and predictable than F1: The Movie, yet retains its Top Gun-style charm led by Brad Pitt‚Äôs affable performance and the story so inoffensive and straightforward that the total experience, albeit forgettable, is a positive one. The entire setup of our hero being a nomad guy who does it not for the fame and glory (anymore), but for the sake of driving of in itself.

      <description>I was a little surprised to see the movie that I had just seen airing in my local movie theaters to get mentioned as a new Criterion physical release in one of their emails I get every now and then. Having a fresh movie off the press like that getting a physical copy must serve as some sort of a strong-ish signal of its relative quality. Especially with all the buzz from its numerous awards and nominations, I realized there is no better way to experience it than on my eight hour long flight from Chicago to Frankfurt in Boeing B747-8‚Äôs Econ...

I did everything in my power to avoid picking this movie for our evening watch.

      <description>Pre-Lynchian nightmare decanted straight out of Robert Altman‚Äôs mind. I genuinely hated the first half of the movie‚Äîeither the mood was not right or I was too tired or simply not in the space to see it for what it is. The second half though took me for such a wild spin that the feeling I was left with after finishing it had haunted me for the next week or so. The absurditiy and terror of the final twenty to thirty minutes of the story evoke such a strong sense of flight or fight that I don‚Äôt have much to say about the plot and many themes t...

There is a good message of the sheer scale of one‚Äôs inner Universe and the absolutely minuscule importance of one‚Äôs life in the grand scheme of the surrounding Universe.

      <description>Torpedoing ourselves back from the late 80s to late 90s, a perfect decade, I find myself in the same situation of seeing all the familiar faces maturing yet again with age as we come out of A Taxing Woman. Not much is different; Nobuko Miyamoto is the star that will steal the show, but in ways I could not have foreseen. Her acting was absolutely superb and it was the first for me in seeing the range she can pull between scenes and within the same scene as well. Going from a ramen chef to a tax inspector to a supermarket manager to an actor-... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/drama/taxing-woman</link>
      <description>Going through Juzo Itami‚Äôs filmography in an almost random-like order offers one of the more jarring experiences I have had with any other director‚Äôs portfolios. The one anchor that is impossible to remove from any of his films, to the point where it would not be a moving picture made by Juzo Itami‚ÄîNobuko Miyamoto starring as the central character, as the heroine of the story, the star that constantly steals the show. One cannot forget the recurring acting staff that pops in and out of his movies at a regula... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>Juzo Itami did it again‚Äîa wonderful story, a Western story of ambition, rivalry, and triumphic glory. If Tampopo told us the story of a struggling ramen shop, then this film‚Äôs core setting is even more mundane‚Äîthe supermarket. Like Goro from Tampopo helping out Tampopo, now we have Tampopo‚Äîplayed by the one and only, Nobuko Miyamoto‚Äîhelping out Goro‚Äôs ‚ÄúHonest Mart‚Äù fight off the existential threat that is the newly-renovated store that is super slimy in its business tactics‚ÄîDisco...

Walking from one room to another only to witness personal tragedies of our characters unfolding one after another in rapid succession.

My partner said it well, ‚ÄúWong Kar-wai is great at building the asymptote of love, desire, and loss.‚Äù There is something to be said of the constant ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äô&#39; going through every character‚Äôs mind.

      <description>Black Bag goes down like a glass of clean sharp martini‚Äîno brine, no olives, and definitely more gin than vermouth. It never loses its focus, never goes onto a tangent that is left unresolved, never does something that doesn‚Äôt feed into its larger story. Drinking it feels refreshing and reassuring that spy thrillers like this still get written and produced. It‚Äôs somewhat similar to &#34;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,&#34; but more modern and carries that boutique store vibe to it. I have enjoyed it thoroughly‚Äîdon‚Äôt think I would be watching it again ... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

Cartoon villains with psychopathic tendencies in goofy ass getup trying to be intimidating in a script where writers have decided that nobody in the audience would be left behind, so they dumbed it down to the slowest and the least caring audience member to follow along as they scroll through their endless tiktok feeds featuring Chalamet and Zendaya as both of them are engaging in an emotionless, hollow, and forced-down-your-throat romance that bears no meaning of the word but to endlessly convince whoever watching tha...

That is Federico Fellini‚Äôs 8¬Ω.

What would the changing political and cultural landscape do to the bond between two brothers‚Äîstressed to its limit with jealousy and betrayal? Farewell My Concubine is a testament to the ideals that every film, director, writer should strive to reach for, or, at the very least, be intimately aware of.

      <title>(Film) A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter</title>
      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/drama/nonsense-christmas</link>
      <description>Until about a week ago I was not aware of Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs existence. Sure, in my vicinity and random places I would hear her songs‚Äîthey always seemed to me as ‚Äúwhatever is popular now‚Äù and I would move on with whatever else I was doing. She‚Äôs good! An innuendo Christmas special, where every shot is candy for the eyes, especially with how fine Sabrina Carpenter looks. I think my favorite song was Cindy Lou Who and the very last ‚Äúfuck‚Äù ...

      <description>Classic of the times‚ÄîI think it must have been more than a decade since the last time I saw this movie. Good thing I haven‚Äôt remembered much‚Äînothing really‚Äîabout the plot nor even the actors. Did not recall initially that Madeleine Stowe was in it and I myself just found out that there is a TV show based on the film, which is kinda lame. However, let‚Äôs get back to the ...

      <description>I just came back from a special screening of Interstella 5555 that was remastered with AI. It was bad. Real bad. This specific critique will cover the re-release and the original release by Mr. Matsumoto, as I have never had a chance to really cover Interstella 5555 nor Daft Punk specifically anywhere around these parts of town. It should be no secret to anyone here‚Äînobody before or after has ever come close to what Daft Punk were able to achieve and unlock with their mastery over the ethereal quality...

      <description>An aggressively mediocre rendition of the original, quite enjoyable for its visual effects, yet wholly lacking in anything substantial or even shallow to say when it comes to its story, message, and legacy. I enjoy thinking about the Roman Empire as much as the next guy‚Äî‚ÄúThink about the Dream of the Roman Empire!‚Äù is such a great meme‚Äîbut this movie felt like a series of scenes and shots optimized to become viral tiktok reels for year...

      <description>Bleak America‚Äîexactly how it is. All these people may live in the same house, share a last name, and spend the night in more or less within each other‚Äôs vicinities, but that is really about it. If you are looking for anything deeper than a surface-level pat‚Äîyou won‚Äôt find it here, not in this film, nor in the real thing. Strangers living together, ever more growing emotionally distant from each other to the point, where they don‚Äôt know the first thing about each other. What is worse, they don‚Äôt even know the first thing about themselves. ... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>It doesn‚Äôt really get more perfect and contained than this. A Dostoevskian-style narrative of a life so busy, dull, and boring that it is functionally no different from being dead. A bureaucrat surrounded by fellow bureaucrats, grinded out by their daily minutia, and finally hollowed out into a living carcass‚Äîdevoid of any purpose or meaning behind it all. Not that it is the most important facet of life, but there is nothing else the... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>A bit of a tough watch if experienced in its original form. In the style of its prose, it was more of Tolstoy‚Äôs moral lecturing than what I feel closer to, which is Dostoevskyian priest, Father Zosima from Brothers Karamazov. Beautifully shot and masterfully acted by Pyotr Mamonov, who himself has walked the path of enhancing one‚Äôs faith. Some moments are heavy-handed as the purpose of what is happening on the screen is already perfectly clear and instead, the telling lacks a certain heart and warmth I would want to see from a telling of a...

      <description>I always like to say that Candide was centuries ahead of his time and this fact hasn‚Äôt changed even today. We aren‚Äôt ready yet, for the wit and sharpness of mind, to which Voltaire presents the absurdity of human condition. It is in fact, so tragic and irredeemably non-sensical that we can‚Äôt do anything in our right minds but to laugh and see it all as a comedy.

Young Asimov‚Äôs novel technologically doesn‚Äôt hold up with the times, such as still using coal for rockets and no computers; yet it doesn‚Äôt have to. It is a detailed study of sociology and how people interact with each other. The focus is on the human aspect rather than shiny technical aspects, which many contemporary authors prioritize over the human touch. Beautiful! Early Asimov in a...

We always imagine evil working as a corrupting force on people ‚Äì bringing their fall upon them. All in a while, the forces of good are actively battling those Machiavellian-like creatures. It‚Äôs all exciting, almost like an action movie, where you can side with one or the other and root for them. What a narrow-minded way of thinkin... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>Did you know Romania has a railway line between Bucharest and Sinaia, a mountain resort popular with high society thanks to its gambling and hotel scene? An express train hurriedly runs from its point of departure to its destination. Passengers on the train are either excited to get a lucky gambling streak at a casino or return to business as usual. Interestingly, none of the people on board would know a small provincial town on the railway. But we also must ask ourselves, how would they know? It‚Äôs not like the train ever bothers to stop ther... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>Politeness theory was proposed by P. Brown and S. Levinson in the late 70s. It focuses on the original notion of politeness, which Mary Henningsen describes as ‚Äûefforts on redressing the affronts to a person‚Äôs self-esteem of effectively claiming positive social values .&#34; The central concept of the theory is based on the idea of the face, understood in terms of sociology. ‚ÄúFace‚Äù is something that can be lost, maintained, or enhanced. &#34;Every person lives in a world of social encounters, involving him either in face-to-face or mediated conta...

      <description>What does it mean to love someone? This is the question I asked myself many times over my own life with its tried and failed attempts at love. Fatefully, one summer, I discovered Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky, which reinvented the many ways I used to perceive what life has to offer. Standing here, I realize what a transitional experience it has been for many people who have had the pleasure and struggle to enter Dostoevsky‚Äôs mind in what has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.

Many spirals themselves into self-imposed depressions, worry without an end, and lock their minds into a constant state of misery. All from a question on life‚Äôs meaning. Is it impossible to answer?

      <description>I switched to Dvorak layout in the summer of 2018. That was a very important time for me, as a couple of months after, I would start my first year in college. Why did I decide to switch to Dvorak and do I still use it four years later? Let us walk through i... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>I love watching anime. It hasn‚Äôt always been like this. I think the first time I got introduced to it was when I was around six or seven. I was living in Bulgaria at that time, I don‚Äôt think we even had Cartoon Network. A small TV somewhere on our backyard porch would run Pok√©mon: Indigo League on some unnamed channel, which I think is as far as you can go in terms of animated pokemon. I was waiting patiently for every &#34;new&#34; episode after coming back home from school. Then there was ... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>&#34;Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages (&#34;mail&#34;) between people using electronic devices. Invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email.&#34;  Email has been around for more than 50 years now. As we go further on our timeline, folks from new generations are starting to forget the beauty of email. This article will discuss the problems with the current s...
