      <description>Wotakoi is near and dear to my heart. It was somewhere around the start of the end of 2022, must have been early December. I got so sick that I’ll take calling me bedridden as a form of flattery. The mood was so special that I even slept in my living room for the entire week, moving all my bedsheets and bedroom-bound belongings over to my big comfy soft inviting w...

      <description>Have gotten to it after following AOT the anime and manga closely for the past decade—the ending was OK. In many ways, it’s a natural ending that as I see it—it played everything till the end very safe. It didn’t try to go and do something crazy (say, killing the rest of humanity EoE-style), but neatly tied all the loose ends together that there is nothing left for the audience to think about or fee...

      <description>“Sandy, you should see Kaguya —it’s one of the best depictions of what it means to have a crush on someone, to have that pull,” a close friend told me about Love is War. I have received the same guidance over many months. It might have been more than a year. Now that I finally took some time off to pay for my sins and liberate myself from the shackles that hurt the mind—I have to watch Kaguya-sama: Lo... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/anime/shinkai</link>
      <description>I think one of the principles of Makoto Shinkai’s films, which I do not regularly find in other “anime” movies or general media, is his sense of expressing the state of waiting and longing. Of course, his romantic plots can get cringy, hopeless, etc., but in my mind, those plots are always ... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>Helltaker by vanripper was my gateway anime. I was into anime way before when I was still a boy, but this absolute-masterpiece-of-an-indie-game was my renaissance. In the final year of university, during one of the tough times when I struggled finding commitment and courage within me on what I wanted to do when so many things changed in my life too quick for me to catch up – those sharply dressed demon girls and the man who wants to have them in his harem by go...

      <description>I don’t like three kinds of people, which boils some of my general views pretty succinctly: people who cheat, people who have a knack for doing wretched things, and finally, people who are on purpose annoyingly loud or inconsiderate of others. Some might even say I have high expectations of people or harshly judge them. It surprises me even further that staying decent human beings isn’t considered common sense anymore. Still, something to be debated and celebrated as an outstanding achievement or an impossible task, especially with how popula... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>My last year at college was the most grueling part of my life. Taking 21 credit hours, three majors, two jobs, not going to Ph.D. or graduate school in favor of going into corporate – it all weighs in on you. No one tells you this. One of the things that gave me immense comfort and an out was Joseph Anderson’s Persona 5 streams. I would watch them while falling asleep, working my jobs, and doing regular homework. A calming voice that was always there. It gave me peace. Very parasocial. ... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

Coincidentally, it happened in the middle of my sophomore year of college. Surprise, it changed everything: how the world works, how we view ourselves, and the new path I’ve chosen to walk on. I’m getting ahead of myself. It happened in the Spring. We are still due to start our reminiscing of the Fall semester.... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>I ask myself what is evil and good. What separates those two? Across generations of poetry, thoughts, and religion, those two have been at each other for as long as time can remember. We always imagine evil working as a corrupting force on people – bringing their fall upon them. All in a while, the forces of good are actively battling those Machiavellian-like creatures. It’s all exciting, almost like an action movie, where you can side with one or the other and root for them. What a narrow-minded way of thinkin... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>Did you know Romania has a railway line between Bucharest and Sinaia, a mountain resort popular with high society thanks to its gambling and hotel scene? An express train hurriedly runs from its point of departure to its destination. Passengers on the train are either excited to get a lucky gambling streak at a casino or return to business as usual. Interestingly, none of the people on board would know a small provincial town on the railway. But we also must ask ourselves, how would they know? It’s not like the train ever bothers to stop ther...

      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/writings/politeness</link>
      <description>Politeness theory was proposed by P. Brown and S. Levinson in the late 70s. It focuses on the original notion of politeness, which Mary Henningsen describes as „efforts on redressing the affronts to a person’s self-esteem of effectively claiming positive social values .&#34; The central concept of the theory is based on the idea of the face, understood in terms of sociology. “Face” is something that can be lost, maintained, or enhanced. &#34;Every person lives in a world of social encounters, involving him either in face-to-face or mediated conta...

      <description>What does it mean to love someone? This is the question I asked myself many times over my own life with its tried and failed attempts at love. Fatefully, one summer, I discovered Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky, which reinvented the many ways I used to perceive what life has to offer. Standing here, I realize what a transitional experience it has been for many people who have had the pleasure and struggle to enter Dostoevsky’s mind in what has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.

You of course can like the things you do throughout the day, however, that time you spend just with yourself is as equally important.

      <description>Eating is important. Eating well is crucial. For years, I have seen myself become the kind of person who eats to live, rather than the other type of living to eat. I would go have my breakfast/lunch/dinner and consume calories just because I knew I had to, otherwise, it wouldn’t go too good for you. This was all right for me at the time, as I had a crazy packed schedule, which hadn’t allowed me to simply slow down and taste what I w... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

What reality are you talking about, my friend? It is absolutely crazy to me that select individuals (many more, actually) dare to dictate one or another how to live by boxing them into their ...

      <description>I observe that video games just aren’t that fun. It is not my intention now to trivialize it down to oh cmon bro, it’s pixels changing on your monitor, but to discuss the effect of video games on us, the entertainment value, and its necessity (or its uselessness) in our lives. Nonetheless, prepare for a hot and a subjective take.... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

My family always lived in the area temporarily, we knew that I will have to go wherever my family does. It’s not like we haven’t tried to keep in touch and call each other whenever I was in the area, but... The feeling was different. We were best friends in school, talking for hours and no end every day. I left for university and he got drafted into... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

A nice table caught my eye and while sitting, I noticed a strange man across the room. He wasn’t dancing or drinking, just sitting, as if he is very deep in his thoughts. Pondering about something. I wonder what. He looked familiar, I couldn’t pinpoint his features, but I recognize this mysterious figure from what feels like a million prior encounters. No need to bother a lonely patro...

      <description>Many go and ask themselves, what is the meaning of life? Some spend their entire lifetimes to come up with an answer that they would feel good or smart about. Many spirals themselves into self-imposed depressions, worry without an end, and lock their minds into a constant state of misery. All from a question on life’s meaning. Is it impossible to answer? Some would say so. Is the answer supposed to be something grand, beautiful, and divine? That is what we can assume from the effort that goes into it. Albert Camus said - &#34;The meaning of lif...

      <link>https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/freshman</link>
      <description>Being a senior in college is weird. I have to confess that I contracted senioritis big time. So much has changed since my first time coming to the University of Kansas. The change was very well expected, actually desired. But what I failed to predict was the number of things that not only will change but completely go away. Don’t forget about this whole pandemic situation that happened right in the middle, kind of pushing me off... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>I love watching anime. It hasn’t always been like this. I think the first time I got introduced to it was when I was around six or seven. I was living in Bulgaria at that time, I don’t think we even had Cartoon Network. A small TV somewhere on our backyard porch would run Pokémon: Indigo League on some unnamed channel, which I think is as far as you can go in terms of animated pokemon. I was waiting patiently for every &#34;new&#34; episode after coming back home from school. Then there was ... [ Continue reading... ]</description>

      <description>Good morning! It’s been a while since I posted anything in the random section. I talked briefly in the past about my music tastes and what kind of music I listen to. I must confess, 12021 has been quite rough in some spots, which affected my taste and playlists in somewhat of a major way. What’s the better way to recap it than using the new handy-dandy Spotify wrapped that sums up everything you did on the platform for th... [ Continue reading... ]</description>
