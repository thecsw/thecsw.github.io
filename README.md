Sandy\'s Website 🚀
==================

Welcome to my website! 🌷
------------------------

### Introduction 🛀

**Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website** - *circa 2007*

I don\'t really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my
home on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes,
webpage updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like
[burger.com](http://burger.com) and
[fmboschetto.it](http://fmboschetto.it). Maybe more people will try to
have their own website that allows them to modify it in any conceivable
way. Please enjoy!

### My cozy blog 💻

### My favorite movies 🎥

I love movies and I think movies deserve a separate full section on my
website. Well, I have taken a Film class my freshman year and I loved
it. Just a class about trash movies. Talk to me about that! Alright,
here is the list:

-   The Godfather
-   The Godfather Part II
-   2001: A Space Odyssey
-   The Big Lebowski

### My favorite shows & soaps 📺🧼

Shows can even have more of a profound effect than movies. Watching a
good show and its experience can even be aphrodisiacal:

-   Pride and Prejudice (1995 by BBC1)
-   Twin Peaks
-   New Girl
-   House
-   Louie
-   Boston Legal

### My favorite books 📚

Reading makes me sleepy, but here are some that give me good dreams:

-   Anna Karenina
-   Solaris
-   The Tao of Pooh
-   A Doll\'s House
-   Foundation series

### This Website 🌐

I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
articles and papers using the following list of tools: `LaTeX`, `groff`,
`markdown`, `Org-Mode`, `asciidoctor`, `HTML`, `plain text`. I had to
decompress Word files and wrestle with raw XML files there, what a trip
that was.

This beautiful website typed in [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and
built using [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org). The source code is
[here](https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io).

It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
Kernighan:

-   [The GO Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/)
-   [C Programming Language, 2nd
    Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
-   [The Unix Programming
    Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment)

### Presentations (Academia)

Here are some presentations made for academia

-   [L\'Hôpital\'s rule](./present/lhopital)

I wish to share this [beautiful
song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Por_una_Cabeza) with you
