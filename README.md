Welcome to my website! 🌷

### Introduction 🛀

**Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website** - *circa 2007*

I don\'t really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my
home on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes,
webpage updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like
[burger.com](http://burger.com) and
[fmboschetto.it](http://fmboschetto.it). Maybe more people will try to
have their own website that allows them to modify it in any conceivable
way. Please enjoy!
