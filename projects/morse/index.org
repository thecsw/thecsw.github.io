* Thinkpad Speaks in Morse Code ðŸ†˜

Morse code powered thinklight. Use your thinkpad to spread the word of Morse!
This is some simple script I finandled around during one beautiful morning when
I woke too early. Super simple, it takes your command line input and turns your
led into morse encoder!
