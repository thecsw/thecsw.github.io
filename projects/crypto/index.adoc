In Spring 2020, the COVID semester, I was taking MATH 601: Cryptography
that was at the time taught by https://witt.ku.edu[Emily Witt]. Probably
one of the hardest undergraduate courses I ever had to take! And
definitely the one I enjoyed the most. We basically covered a big chunk
of Group and Ring theory as background material during our first week. I
just learned the material for my separate Group Theory class from
Professor Witt in a week. Fun!

Essential part of the course was us writing code to run some basic
algorithms (greatest common divisor, extended euclidean algorithm,
chinese remainder theorem) and not-so-basic (William's p+1 algorithm,
Pollard's p-1 algorithm, Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization, etc.).
After we were done with the course during the 2020 pandemic, I decided
to release some code snippets I wrote during the course. The files are
heavily commented but not properly documented (I should probably find
some time for that)
