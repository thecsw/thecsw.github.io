* I write crypto in python  🍾
In Spring 2020, the COVID semester, I was taking MATH 601: Cryptography that
was at the time taught by [[https://witt.ku.edu][Emily Witt]]. Probably one of the hardest
undergraduate courses I ever had to take! And definitely the one I enjoyed
the most. We basically covered a big chunk of Group and Ring theory as
background material during our first week. I just learned the material for my
separate Group Theory class from Professor Witt in a week. Fun!

Essential part of the course was us writing code to run some basic
algorithms (greatest common divisor, extended euclidean algorithm, chinese
remainder theorem) and not-so-basic (William's p+1 algorithm, Pollard's p-1
algorithm, Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization, etc.). After we were done
with the course during the 2020 pandemic, I decided to release some code
snippets I wrote during the course. The files are heavily commented but not
properly documented (I should probably find some time for that)
