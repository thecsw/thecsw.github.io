* Sandy's tutoring notes 📝
During Spring 2021 semester, I worked as a tutor for the School of
Engineering. As one of the tutors, we held multiple a series of study
sessions every week, on subjects and classes ranging from Calculus I/II/III
to Phyics I/II and Chemistry I/II.

I took digital notes on my tablet during every meeting and they have just
been fully documented on a separate webpage. I taught Calculus II, Calculus
III, and Physics I. It was a lot of fun!

If you are a student and struggling
with some of the courses above, you can look at the notes as a bank of
problems with detailed solutions. As a tutor or a grader or a teaching
assistant, you would be able to find a good source of teaching material and
the curriculum of those courses.
