* Phantasos - Goodbye, CS@KU ðŸ¥‘

In my senior year of Computer Science bachelors, we undertook a year-long team
project, which is called to be our capstone. I worked in a fantastic team with
[[https://www.linkedin.com/in/grant-holmes/][Grant Holmes]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/malena-schoeni-6a8127187/][Malena Schoeni]], [[https://github.com/CHarrod283][Carter Hurrod]], and [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-figueroa-j/][Rodrigo Figueroa]]! My role in
the group was more of a manager, such as keeping up with our deliverables,
communication, conflict resolution, and project management. Supa thankful for
such a great team and what we were able to do.

#+drop_cap
Our team/project is called [[https://github.com/RealPhantasos][Phantasos]], after a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasos][Roman God of Sleep]]. The goal was
to develop a system that expands the userâ€™s interactive capability of
interfacing with a computer using multiple sensors. Keyboards? Mice? This is old
tech from the 60s. There is lots of friction between computers and users; let us
explore new ways that we can interact with them. In many ways, this idea has
been significantly inspired by [[https://sandyuraz.com/anime/sao/][Sword Art Online]].

Please see the final demo video below.
