* Become a True Meme Investor ðŸ’¸

/Take yourself back to Spring 2018/

I am finally done with my IB exams. These two years were just brutal. I was
longing for a break and now I got it. So... what do I do now? Well, I found this
interesting subreddit [[https://reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy][r/MemeEconomy]]. People post memes and joke about investing
with profits. So I think to myself, why not make it real?

I went to see Deadpool 2 with my friends today and my parents have some guests
visiting tonight, so that means I have an evening to do whatever. I sat down and
punched down some python code that catches =!invest AMOUNT= comments on the
subreddit, uses karma difference in time for a linear profit formula, and stores
everything in a single text file. Sounds good to me!

It all took about an hour or so of code writing, an hour more of
testing/debugging, and a couple of minutes to run it public on my trusty
Raspberry Pi 3. Ah, it's running now. Probably won't be used by more
than... let's say ten people. Let me write down =!create= to create an account for
myself, =!invest 100= for fun, and see the guests.

Huh, my phone is blowing up? Oh. My. God. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/just_made_this_format_have_i_struck_gold/][It blew up.]] Big time. On the same
evening the bot first came live, a couple of people spotted this interesting
reddit bot that recognizes commands to invest in memes? Let's all create and
account and see what's it's about!! Oh crap. The measely text file corrupted
with number of writes and it of course [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/comment/dzetc6b][crashed]]

Hey mom, dad, I need to go upstairs real quick. Be right back. Okay. I remember
like a week ago I've heard about this thing called /S-Q-L-Lite?/ I don't know how
to use the big boy databases, but this one just uses a file. Okay, let me
quickly swap the file-based functions with sqlite-based functions.

Alright, push it live right back up. Let's make meme investments real! I'm
hungry, let me go downstairs and have faith in my coding

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/comment/dzeefkl][Early investors]] saw very good returns

[[300.png][My man, I have invested 300 in this meme, donâ€™t let me down]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/comment/dzecssj][Some people]] even liked the new feature!

[[invest.png][I finally understand this subreddit]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/comment/dzeeev4][Some]] even bet their everything

[[fullinvest.png][ballsy move, will it pay?]]

You might wonder, how did the bot work back then? Here is the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/comment/dzet1ec][help message]] and
available commands at the time

And here are the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lc19o/comment/dzed7e6][messages]] with investment updates

And 15 thousand more messages that are just =!create=, =!invest=, and
=!balance=. Dinner was good and I'm happy with how this little meme investor
turned out. I wonder how I can work on it more?

/So what about today?/

Well, this whole project turned out to be more than I thought it would be. It
was... *fantastic*! I had over 25 people joining me on development. Even
developers from the real world contributed to the project, taught me many
invaluable skills, and an understanding of what it means to manage a
project. This story has been retold many times and I will shorten it because
it's very late right now and I'm watching Death Note.

I have been maintaining and working on the project for a little bit more than
three years. We had dozens of developers from across the world contributing
code, advice, and technical support to MemeInvestor. We amassed more than
100,000 registered users, with an all-time peak of 10,000 active daily users. An
r/MemeEconomy creator and my partner [[https://reddit.com/u/Noerdy][Noerdy]] incorporated our little venture into
an LLC. Sometime later, our humble project got acquired by EnterMeme.

Wait, why acquired? For how much? How was it? Let me answer one by one. Frankly,
maintaining an active project while grinding in college did wear me out in some
places, so I've found myself burnt on the project. Development (as a sole
engineer at that time) took way longer than expected. Not a lot of passion left
for it. At one point, I was starting to look to find a new maintainer, just to
offload MIB (the new version of MemeInvestor) onto someone, who can actually do
something about it.

I can't say how much specifically, but do not think it was an "exit". Think of
the acquisition as just switching maintainers at that point. I was just happy
that I could focus on other things, as I did not have the heart in me to just
shut it down and shelve it. That is still how I feel. I am glad to finally have
been able to move on to greener pastures and spend more time on projects that
drive more passion within me.

I wish EnterMeme, which is now officially [[https://meme.market][meme.market]] commercial and social
success it's looking for and actively working towards.

Thank you and Goodbye, MemeInvestor_bot.
