* Find Movie Quotes from a Picture ðŸ—¡

When I was a wee lad in high school, I made a Reddit bot that listened to any
new submissions on the [[https://reddit.com/r/prequelmemes][r/prequelmemes]], apply OCR, and it shows the exact
timestamp of when any found quotes appear in the prequel trilogy of Star Wars. I
really liked prequelmemes back in the day. This project has long been
unmaintained and shut down after it successfully accumulated over 50k karma.
