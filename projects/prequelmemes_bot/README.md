Find Movie Quotes from a Picture ðŸ—¡
==================================

When I was a wee lad in high school, I made a Reddit bot that listened
to any new submissions on the
[r/prequelmemes](https://reddit.com/r/prequelmemes), apply OCR, and it
shows the exact timestamp of when any found quotes appear in the prequel
trilogy of Star Wars. I really liked prequelmemes back in the day. This
project has long been unmaintained and shut down after it successfully
accumulated over 50k karma.
