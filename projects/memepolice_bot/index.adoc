I remember the days when
https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions[r/PewdiepieSubmissions]
had fewer than 10 thousand members. I was among one of the first posters
there and I thought the quality of some submissions was *really bad*. So
what can a 17 year old high school computer scientist do? Make a bot
that scans a reddit submission for stale memes. Call it the
`MemePolice_bot`. More details in the link below
