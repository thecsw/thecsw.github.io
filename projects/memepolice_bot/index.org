* Spot and Prosecute Bad Memes 👮‍♀️

I remember the days when [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions][r/PewdiepieSubmissions]] had fewer than 10 thousand
members. I was among one of the first posters there and I thought the quality of
some submissions was *really bad*. So what can a 17 year old high school computer
scientist do? Make a bot that scans a reddit submission for stale memes. Call it
the =MemePolice_bot=. More details in the link below
