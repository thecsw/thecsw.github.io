* Счастье маленького человека 🧥
In the Spring of 2021, I took one of the best courses ever! This was
RUSS 712, a graduate class in Russian Literature. We read all the beautiful
short stories by such masters like Pushkin (Blizzard), Gogol (The Overcoat)
Tolstoy (Blizzard), Chekhov (The Lady with the Dog), Dostoevsky (The Dream of
a Ridiculous Man), and dozens more. We would progress ourselves into modern
times, so starting from 19th century and ending up somewhere in 2010s.

As a final project for the course, we had to make a 15-minute recorded video
of us talking in TED-talk style about a research topic of our choice. My
choice was called Счастье маленького человека (Little Man's Happiness), where
I contemplated about what does it mean for a fallen man to be happy, basing
on works of Gogol, "The Overcoat", and Dostoevsky, "The Dream of a Ridiculous
Man". The video itself is in Russian. Sorry, I just couldn't bring myself to
record an English version after doing close to 50 full takes of my talk.

At least you get to see a moving picture of me! Haha
