* The Art of Computer Science ❤️

My name is Sandy Urazayev and I would like to invite you to my talk “The Art of
Computer Science”. This talk has been sponsored by KU chapter of ACM.

Follow me on a philosophical discussion of what is Computer Science? What does
that make us to be? Are we engineers, scientists, or artists? 

Let us talk and ponder on something that no one else does. We will come to
revelations of our own and the future that awaits.

The presentation deck is [[./deck.pdf][available here]].
