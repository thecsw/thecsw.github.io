* Katya or The Liberated Corpus ðŸ™ˆ

The need for linguistic analysis has been increasing steadily over the past
couple of decades. As the interest and the number of research questions
increased, so did the demand for amount of language data and its
observations. Unfortunately, one cannot spend his time meticulously searching
for words and constructs in question, as such endeavor might take a lifetime or
two to complete. Everyone should agree that human time should be spent more
preciously, so we employ computers and automated systems to collect and analyze
linguistic data en masse.

Let us define a corpus to be a vast (or smaller) collection of authentic text,
such as literature, transcripts of real-life conversations, newspapers,
etc. Corpus linguistics will be defined as a discipline of linguistics, which
relies on inquiries and results based on such a corpus. This allows researchers
to process large amounts of data that could not have been parsed before, simply
due to limitations in both the human time and resources. Katya is an example of
such a corpus that focuses on features that will allow researchers to do what no
other existing and commercial corpora provide. 

Katya is the liberated corpus that is focused on addressing the issues
above. The big difference of Katya is that it allows users to provide their own
web link, which will serve as a source of data that can be queried later. Katya
accomplishes this by web scraping user link. More on that in the next
section. Katya is capable of exporting complete search results. Another
advantage is that Katya's code and infrastructure is public, such that anyone
could learn how it works for educational purposes and other developers could
contribute to the platform.
