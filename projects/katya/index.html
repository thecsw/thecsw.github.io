<p>The need for linguistic analysis has been increasing steadily over the
past couple of decades. As the interest and the number of research
questions increased, so did the demand for amount of language data and
its observations. Unfortunately, one cannot spend his time meticulously
searching for words and constructs in question, as such endeavor might
take a lifetime or two to complete. Everyone should agree that human
time should be spent more preciously, so we employ computers and
automated systems to collect and analyze linguistic data en masse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let us define a corpus to be a vast (or smaller) collection of authentic
text, such as literature, transcripts of real-life conversations,
newspapers, etc. Corpus linguistics will be defined as a discipline of
linguistics, which relies on inquiries and results based on such a
corpus. This allows researchers to process large amounts of data that
could not have been parsed before, simply due to limitations in both the
human time and resources. Katya is an example of such a corpus that
focuses on features that will allow researchers to do what no other
existing and commercial corpora provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Katya is the liberated corpus that is focused on addressing the issues
above. The big difference of Katya is that it allows users to provide
their own web link, which will serve as a source of data that can be
queried later. Katya accomplishes this by web scraping user link. More
on that in the next section. Katya is capable of exporting complete
search results. Another advantage is that Katya&#8217;s code and
infrastructure is public, such that anyone could learn how it works for
educational purposes and other developers could contribute to the
platform.</p>
