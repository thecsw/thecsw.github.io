* Make Collatz Conjecture Graphs ðŸ“‰

In high school I became interested in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture][Collatz conjecture]] and thought the
stopping time graphs are quite pretty, like the one below shows the steps =27= has
to take to reach the terminal =1=.

I made a little telegram bot that sends you the stopping graph for any number
that you give it.
