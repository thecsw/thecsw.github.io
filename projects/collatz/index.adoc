In high school I became interested in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture[Collatz conjecture] and
thought the stopping time graphs are quite pretty, like the one below
shows the steps `27` has to take to reach the terminal `1`.

I made a little telegram bot that sends you the stopping graph for any
number that you give it.
