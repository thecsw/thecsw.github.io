* Sentocks or Sentimental stocks 💇‍♀️
A group of my friends and I created a platform that continuously listens to
tweets mentioning various publicly traded companies and we compare the
general audience's sentiment to companies' stock value! It was a fun project
we did for EECS 448: Software Engineering. The project is well-documented
with some pretty pictures and results that we got. Answer? Well, after
applying some signal processing techniques, filtering out bad data, matching
timesets, we found that there is a very loose correlation. Sometimes it's
very good! Sometimes, it's the complete opposite.
