A group of my friends and I created a platform that continuously listens
to tweets mentioning various publicly traded companies and we compare
the general audience's sentiment to companies' stock value! It was a fun
project we did for EECS 448: Software Engineering. The project is
well-documented with some pretty pictures and results that we got.
Answer? Well, after applying some signal processing techniques,
filtering out bad data, matching timesets, we found that there is a very
loose correlation. Sometimes it's very good! Sometimes, it's the
complete opposite.
