* Daemonize your go programs 👹

Daemonize your go programs by locking the [[https://www.baeldung.com/linux/pid-file][process id file]].
Simply put the following at the top of your =main=,

#+begin_src go
func main() {
    defer pid.Start("monokuma").Stop()
    // your code...
}
#+end_src

This will create a =monokuma.pid= file in =/tmp= with the process id (pid) of the go
program when loaded by your operating system. When your `main` exits, the file will be
cleaned up.

This will prevent any other instances of your program running at the same time (say running
a web server or overloading some resources). Say, when I run

#+begin_src
λ monokuma
#+end_src

I can find the PID of it with (no line feed at the end),

#+begin_src
λ cat /tmp/monokuma.pid
91100⏎
#+end_src

If I try to start the same program, I will be greeted by

#+begin_src
λ ./monokuma
2023/05/17 23:03:03 your app with pid 91100 is already running
#+end_src
