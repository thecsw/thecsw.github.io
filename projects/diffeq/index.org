* Differential equations oracles 🧎‍♀️
I also worked as a grader for Ordinary Differential Equations course (MATH
220), taught by Professor Van Vleck from the department of Mathematics at
University of Kansas. Interestingly enough, one of my responsibilities was
also typing up all the weekly homework solutions so that they can be used as
"oracles", i.e. "source of truth" when grading students' submissions.

This was quite an experience, because it has been a while since my intro ODE
class. In a way, it felt like taking another courseload, as I had to type
everything in LaTeX. Solutions are available both in the web form (rendered
by [[https://www.mathjax.org][MathJax]]) and in PDF form (rendered with [[https://www.latex-project.org][LaTeX]]). This might be a good
source to catch up on your ODEs!
