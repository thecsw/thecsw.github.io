* Cool pure C++ data structures 🏛
EECS 560: Data Structures taught by [[https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~s906s230/][Dr. Suzanne M. Shontz]] has been a fun
class! A lot of reading and on-paper-algorithm-analysis and dry running. The
course itself was also accompanied by a series of labs, where we would
implement various data structures that we learned in class. Such a list
includes but not limited to: Binary Search Trees, Priority Queues (Leftist
trees, min heaps, max heaps, min-max heaps), Linked Lists, Hash Tables
(various sorts of addressing and hash conflict resolution functions), etc.

I took the code I wrote for some of those labs and published them in a
separate repo. Maybe it can serve as a good source to look up some simple
data structures. Do not copy or plagiarize the work for your own labs.
Some quick documentation follows in the repository itself.
