* Build a MIPS Emulator in VHDL ðŸ’¼

For my EECS 645: Computer Architecture, the final project of the course involved
us designining our very own CPU microarchitecture that accepts a subset of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture][MIPS]]. It was quite fun learning the intricacies of how CPUs are built, with all
the pipelines, hazards, etc. In many ways, after this course, I fear no assembly
and reading it comes more naturally. The only caveat was that we were writing it
all in a parallel programming paradigm in VHDL. I don't really want to touch
VHDL in the near future.
