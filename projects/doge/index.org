* Farm Clicks with Doge Clicker 🐶

This is by far the oldest, yet most complete project I could find. I think I was
a freshman in high school and made this doge farm clicker for some kind of a
in-school programming competition (got the second place lol). This is yet
another proof that I was into Doge before it was cool. Way back in 2013-2014?

Another funny thing is that the source code is lost. So the only files I have is
the actual =.exe= file that was made using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)][Delphi]]. Dark times, but this is how I
was introduced to programming. Through Pascal and Delphi, the latter being an
object-oriented version of the former.

/I made Doge Clicker in Delphi 7, [[https://delphi.embarcadero.com/project/delphi-7/][which is from 2002]]/
