* Write a compiler in C++ from nil 🍺
C-rona is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative, and
statically-typed programming language written in C++. Our final project
contains a fully working compiler for x86_64 machines, which itself was a
semester long project for EECS 665: Compiler Construction, where we learned
the art of building compilers from scratch and this is the result. 
   
EECS 665: Compiler Construction was taught by the fantastic [[https://ittc.ku.edu/~drew/][Drew Davidson]],
who made probably one of the classicaly toughest courses in undergraduate
career into one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken in my
Computer Science undergrad. I must boast a little bit here and confess that
this might objectively be the best engineering course at my university and
probably the best compilers course work globally.
   
I worked on the project with [[https://github.com/zatkins-dev][Zachary Atkins]] and without him I wouldn't have
gotten anywhere. We were great partners throughout the whole semester.
