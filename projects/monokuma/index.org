* Shortening URLs in style 🧸

NOTE: As of June 27th, 2025, I went back to using native images within the
target repository for two main reasons: OneDrive, my poor man's CDN broke all
the historical embeds with no easy mapping to their new format---lame; having
pictures included as a part of the repository's source code makes more sense for
my usage.

This is Sandy's custom URL shortener that works through Redis.
I wanted to learn how to use custom TLS Redis and I wanted to make a URL shortener.
So I did both. Done. hah.

Well, on my website, I also have many gallery pages, which are powered by OneDrive that
have really long URLs. I wanted to shorten them so that I can share them more easily.

If you go to [[https://sandyuraz.com/cooking][Cooking together 🍜]] and open the source code, you will see that all
the images are now calling to [[https://photos.sandyuraz.com][photos.sandyuraz.com]]. Makes before and after look
pretty nice.

#+html_tags: style="width:45rem"
[[before.webp][before 🤢]]

and after sending them all through my url shortener,

#+html_tags: style="width:45rem"
[[after.webp][after 😇]]

Overall, it's pretty quick and with some internal caching, each lookup is a
couple of microseconds (though the network overhead is 10000x of that).

Another program, [[https://github.com/thecsw/nagito][nagito]] has been written to interact with monokuma and
efficiently shorten links. You can stand up your own =monokuma= with little effort
and in whatever ways you want ([[../certificates][TLS]], auth, urls, randomization, alphabet, etc).
