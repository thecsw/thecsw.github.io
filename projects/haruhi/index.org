* HTTP just like SOS Brigade 🐰

Welcome! This is Sandy's take on making a simple yet powerful enough
HTTP library. Inspired by [[https://github.com/psf/requests][python's requests]].

** Motivation

When it comes to making network requests, I find myself writing a lot of
repetitive go code, you know the gist of getting a json response,

#+begin_src go
  ctx := context.WithTimeout(context.TODO(), time.Minute)
  req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, method, URLpath, body)
  if err != nil { /* ... */ }

  params := req.URL.Query()
  params.Add(key, value)
  // more great parameters you need
  req.URL.RawQuery = params.Encode()

  resp, err := client.Do(req)
  if err != nil { /* ...  */ }
  defer resp.Body.Close()

  // do a response status check if needed...

  ans := &SomeStruct{}
  if err != json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(ans); err != nil { /*... */ }

  // whatever other magic you need to do!
#+end_src

This is still a condensed version! The example above skips a couple of steps for
brevity, like setting timeouts, deadlines, proper reading, buffering, progress, etc. 

You can end up making something of your own, but repeating the same code has
many issues, such as forgetting to close the response body or set proper
contexts with plenty more.

** Examples

What if instead, all you had to write was

#+begin_src go
ans := &SomeStruct{}
err := haruhi.URL(URLpath).
    Method(method).
    Params(params).
    Body(body).
    Timeout(time.Minute).
    ResponseJSON(ans)
#+end_src

and it did everything for you? You can even simplify it with haruhi's sensible
defaults, such as running a =GET= request by default, etc, so you could even do

#+begin_src go
respStr, err := haruhi.URL(url).Get()
#+end_src

Haruhi of course, supports more funtionality that is aimed to be simple and
straight-forward. Entire codebase is documented, so head on to [[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/thecsw/haruhi][go docs]] to see
what else she can do.

Have fun requesting!

** Why Haruhi?

Because [[https://letterboxd.com/thecsw/film/the-melancholy-of-haruhi-suzumiya/][Endless Eight is a cinematic masterpiece]] and [[https://haruhi.fandom.com/wiki/Haruhi_Suzumiya][Haruhi is life itself]].

** Development

Please visit the github page and let me know through issues or PRs if you have
any questions!
