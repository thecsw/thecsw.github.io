For my EECS 678: Operating Systems course, one of the projects we have
to do is build our own Unix shell, which would be able to interpret
commands and execute them accordingly. We support basic features, such
as subprocess execution, background processes, `PATH` lookups, arbitrary
number of pipes, shell built-in commands, and a nice command line
experience with arrow keys with history.

Made with ❤️ by Sandy Urazayev and Jacob McNamee.
