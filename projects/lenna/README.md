Compress images with PCA ðŸŽ±
==========================

MATH 596: Computational Data Science by [Erik S. Van
Vleck](https://erikvv.ku.edu) was quite a trip. The philosophy of the
course was \"sink-or-swim\", which means that you either succeed in the
class and what\'s expected or you just fail it completely. Never have I
ever gone through a more brutal multivariate statistics crash course. I
must admit that I met some wonderful people there that I never would
have had a chance to make an acquaintance with, if it weren\'t for this
class.

Our first small project was applying [Principal Component Analysis
(PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to
some old or new problems. I liked the theory and wanted to see how well
I can compress images, therefore extracting the most important
(principal, haha) components of a data set and present an approximation
of it by only using a fraction of the original set. I did in in python,
I recommend running `lenna.py` if you\'re curious to see how it works.
