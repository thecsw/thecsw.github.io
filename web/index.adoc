I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
articles and papers using the following list of tools: `LaTeX`, `groff`,
`markdown`, `Org-Mode`, `asciidoctor`, `HTML`, `plain text`. I had to
decompress Word files and wrestle with raw XML files there, what a trip
that was.

This beautiful website typed in https://orgmode.org/[Org-Mode] and built
using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]. The source code is
https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io[here].

It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
Kernighan:

* https://www.gopl.io/[The GO Programming Language]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language[C Programming
Language, 2nd Edition]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment[The
Unix Programming Environment]
