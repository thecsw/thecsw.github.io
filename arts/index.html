<p>I wish to talk here with you about aesthetics and fine art. Some things
we might enjoy alone or together! Historically, my website had different
sections for my favorite films, songs, shows, etc. I thought it would be
nice to wrap them all up together and call it "Les Arts". This page
should be able to present my interests and hobbies in a more centralized
and coherent manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let us get books and reading out of the way. After trying out almost
every genre of book, I found out what tickles and touches me in all the
right ways. Russian Classical Literature, primarily 19th century,
including but not limited to Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol,
Chekhov, Bulgakov, etc. As my public speaking professor put, "Only
Russian Literature has made the venture into who we are, the core within
us. While all the other went external."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, this does not limit me from enjoying any other genre. I love
Asimov, some medieval literature (Beowulf is a great example), classical
philosophy (I adore Voltaire), and something in between. Tao of Pooh is
also a fantastic work of literature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Movies‚Ä¶ probably watched too many for my age. In some ways, like Eugene
Onegin, I became very much disinterested in them, even to the extent of
repulsion by the new cinema scene. Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to explain, but
all the comedy is the new tragedy and what is supposed to be tragic is
something to laugh at. Arts should help us to define ourselves, our
taste in fine things. However, all I see now is just‚Ä¶ unwatchable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though I do not want to end the movies part on such a sad note. Here are
my favorite movies that I tend to rewatch dozens of times: The Godfather
I and II (probably best cinema ever), Gone with the Wind (no better
tragedy/romance, almost felt like War and Peace), 2001: A Space Odyssey
(the grandfather of Science-Fiction), La La Land (good contemporary
musical)‚Ä¶ I can&#8217;t even remember the rest, though I always knew them by
heart. Oh well, those listed above are really good (completely
subjective).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From films to shows. Not a whole lot different from what we&#8217;ve talked
about before. Maybe I just became cynical towards everything new, oh
well. I guess that happened a little too soon than I have anticipated. I
wanted to watch some shows with my friends and then-girlfriend, but
what&#8217;s supposed to be funny is just sad (how the misery of others is
just a funny trope) and low taste. There are a couple that is dear to my
heart: Pride and Prejudice (1995 by BBC1), Twin Peaks (can&#8217;t watch it
anymore), Boston Legal (good 2000s), Neon Genesis Evangelion (there was
a month in my life where I actively watched anime), and Tengen Toppa
Gurren Lagann (Who the hell do you think I am?!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, music! We always talk about each other&#8217;s taste in
music, our favorite artists, groups, etc. I&#8217;ve always had a hard time
answering that, simply because I just wasn&#8217;t exposed to a lot of
personal listening when I was younger. When I did though, fell in love
with Daft Punk (love you forever). After playing a lot of Fallout: New
Vegas, I had a walkman with the 50s and 60s country loaded onto it. Big
Iron! Later, I made a
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3kEBOeXVLWG3Y8P3KUEn1a?si=8bcd5d952f7d4011">spotify
playlist</a> with the banging 80s, 90s, and wild 2000s. I have to confess,
now I just limit myself to
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ZZv8ppIChHJeNoj5rW3oC?si=18b24d7ae7174973">alyonna</a>,
my main playlist that contains all sorts of classical and waltz works.
