*** Introduction 🛀

    *Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website* - /circa 2007/

    I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my home
    on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes, webpage
    updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
    website. There is something very profound about Web 1.0, like [[http://burger.com][burger.com]] and
    [[http://fmboschetto.it][fmboschetto.it]]. Maybe more people will try to have their own website that
    allows them to modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!

    I have a page where you can learn more [[./aboutme][about me 🤔]]

  TIP: Scroll to the bottom for details on how this website is built.

    interesting!

*** My favorite movies 🎥
    I love movies and I think movies deserve a separate full section on my
    website. Well, I have taken a Film class my freshman year and I loved it. It was
    a class about trash movies. Talk to me about that! Alright, here is the
    list:
    - The Godfather
    - The Godfather Part II
    - 2001: A Space Odyssey
    - The Big Lebowski
*** My favorite books 📚
    I love reading too! Here is some list of my favorites:
    - Solaris
    - The Tao of Pooh
    - A Doll's House
*** This Website 🌐

  I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
  articles and papers using the following list of tools: =LaTeX=, =groff=,
  =markdown=, =Org-Mode=, =asciidoctor=, =HTML=, =plain text=. I had to
  uncompress Word files and work with raw XML files there, what a trip
  that was.

  This beautiful website typed in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] and built using [[http://asciidoctor.org][Asciidoctor]]. The
  source code can be found [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io][here]].

  It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
  Kernighan:
