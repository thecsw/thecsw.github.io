*** Introduction 🛀
    *Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website* - /circa 2007/
    
    I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my home
    on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes, webpage
    updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
    website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like [[http://burger.com][burger.com]] and
    [[http://fmboschetto.it][fmboschetto.it]]. Maybe more people will try to have their own website that
    allows them to modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!
