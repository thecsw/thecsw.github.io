*** Introduction 🛀

    *Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website* - /circa 2007/
    
    I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my home
    on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes, webpage
    updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
    website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like [[http://burger.com][burger.com]] and
    [[http://fmboschetto.it][fmboschetto.it]]. Maybe more people will try to have their own website that
    allows them to modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!

*** My favorite movies 🎥
    I love movies and I think movies deserve a separate full section on my
    website. Well, I have taken a Film class my freshman year and I loved it. It was
    a class about trash movies. Talk to me about that! Alright, here is the
    list:
    - The Godfather
    - The Godfather Part II
    - 2001: A Space Odyssey
    - The Big Lebowski

*** My favorite shows & soaps 📺🧼
    Shows can even have more of a profound effect than movies. Watching a good
    show and its experience can even be aphrodisiacal:
    - Pride and Prejudice (1995 by BBC1)
    - Twin Peaks
    - New Girl
    - House
    I like watching soaps and straight up showing all symptoms of an addict when
    I find something good, like Billions, Homeland, etc. (Going through
    withdrawal rn)

*** My favorite books 📚
    Reading makes me sleepy, but here are some that give me good dreams: 
    - Anna Karenina
    - Solaris
    - The Tao of Pooh
    - A Doll's House
    - Foundation series
*** This Website 🌐
    
    I love typesetting tools. In my experience, I have used and written
    articles and papers using the following list of tools: =LaTeX=, =groff=,
    =markdown=, =Org-Mode=, =asciidoctor=, =HTML=, =plain text=. I had to
    decompress Word files and wrestle with raw XML files there, what a trip
    that was.
    
    This beautiful website typed in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] and built using [[http://asciidoctor.org][Asciidoctor]]. The
    source code is [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io][here]].
    
    It is one of my dreams to typeset documents and books like Brian
    Kernighan:
    
  - [[https://www.gopl.io/][The GO Programming Language]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language][C Programming Language, 2nd Edition]] 
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment][The Unix Programming Environment]]
*** Good stuff 💃💃💃
    I wish to share this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Por_una_Cabeza][beautiful song]] with you
