* Sandy's dossier 🖋

Call me Sandy. Some moons ago - no clue how or when exactly - having no
last-minute assignments left to do, and projects, in particular, to obsess with,
I thought I would make a simple website and explore the world of writing. It is
a way I use to interact with the world and express myself. Whenever I find
myself needing to share something; whenever it is good a time, revolutionary
March in my soul; whenever I find myself trying out new tech; and especially
whenever my curiosity overshadows the other me, that it requires an Aristotelian
virtue to prevent me from sinking all my time, and methodically ignoring every
other commitment in life - then, I consider it to be the moment of truth.

I studied Literature with concentration in 19th century literature. Dostoyevsky
is my favorite author. There is also a weak spot in me for science fiction,
especially anything that Isaac Asimov wrote. [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/anime][Love anime]]. Also graduated with
degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. Also, thoughts ≠ employer.
