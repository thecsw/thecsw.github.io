I love movies and I think movies deserve a separate full section on my
website. Well, I have taken a Film class my freshman year and I loved
it. Just a class about trash movies. Talk to me about that! Alright,
here is the list:

* The Godfather
* The Godfather Part II
* 2001: A Space Odyssey
* The Big Lebowski
