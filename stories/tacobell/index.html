<p>Nothing felt the same as it used to. I looked around the room,
everything seems to be in place, but‚Ä¶ this feeling. This feeling of
uneasiness and doubts is sinking deeper and deeper into me. Stuff like
this always happens for the wrong reasons, at the wrong times. I think
to myself, why do I allow it to get to me?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I need to go and get a breath of fresh air, see friends, and live a
little bit. There I go again, <em>living</em>. Am I not <em>living</em> right now? No
matter, the more I go into it in this state of mind, the more I will get
lost in this never ending stream of verbal bazaar. I haven&#8217;t been to
Taco Bell in a while, I wonder what it&#8217;s like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Weird, I don&#8217;t like Mexican food, it overwhelms my tastebuds and my
digestive system is just not friends with it. But I&#8217;m craving for it big
time. Last time I was there, life was different, people around me were
different. Not in a good or a bad way. Just different.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I walk down the street. I should probably call someone over in that
phone booth. Who should I call? I don&#8217;t know, all I do know is that I
want to talk to someone. I walk into the booth, look right, and I freeze
in terror. I see a dark figure approaching the booth. Not just walking
in the same direction, but coming here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The menacing figure grows larger, footsteps get louder, and finally, I
hear it say "Yo Sandy, what are you doing here?". Ah, it&#8217;s my friend
Rodrigo. "I&#8217;m alright, what are you doing here?", I asked. There was no
reply. "Listen, Sandy, don&#8217;t forget to submit the individual report
tonight", he told me after an awkward second pause, which he didn&#8217;t seem
to mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ah yes, thank you, I&#8217;ll do that!", I replied hastily, not knowing where
it came from or where it&#8217;s gonna go. "Good, chao" is what I heard from
Rodrigo as he quickly parted our impromptu rendezvous spot. My mind
started writing the individual report, what did I do this week?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, I do keep everyone in the group on pace with our deadlines and
sprints. Conducting code reviews is a big part of the job that I enjoy,
so I reviewed the new features developed by the team this week and
tested them out on different machines. Finally, I worked with Grant on
forming our documentation foundation, where we would log tech details as
a database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That should be enough", I said to myself quitely. Speaking of quiet,
the phone hasn&#8217;t been so quiet for a hot second. It&#8217;s been ringing for a
little while, I was deep in my thoughts. Shouldn&#8217;t I have callen
someone? Why is someone calling this random booth? I pick up the phone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Don&#8217;t imply your plan for next week..", the phone uttered and hung up
immediately. Ah, I see. Next week I am planning to start designing the
final consolidator for all of our armband/eyetracker features, and
working with the team with accommodating all the functionality and
libraries' APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I left the phone booth, the mission was complete now. My hunger hasn&#8217;t
died down yet, why should it have? Now, where is that Taco Bell‚Ä¶</p>
