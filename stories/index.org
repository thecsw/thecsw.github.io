* Short stories üç≤

65; 12022 H.E.

This is an (incomplete) collection of short stories that I wrote here and
there. Some of them were for fun. Some of them were for a gag. Some of them for
assignments that never asked for it. Please enjoy!

- [[./aristotle][That time I spoke with Aristotle about his virtue ethics and Sufism]]
- [[./today][Today must be the day when I get the courage]]
- [[./tacobell][Write a report? But I want to go to Taco Bell]]
