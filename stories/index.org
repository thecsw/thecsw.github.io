* Short stories 🍲

This is an (incomplete) collection of short stories that I wrote here and
there. Some of them were for fun. Some of them for a gag. Some of them for
assignments that didn't ask for it. Please enjoy!

*** [[./aristotle][That time I spoke with Aristotle about his virtue ethics and Sufism]]
