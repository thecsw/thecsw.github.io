I can’t be late. I can’t be late. I cannot be late. Donald Knuth himself is coming to the presentation tonight; I want to see him and all the other special guests we are having. Jame and Ethan should already be there. Hopefully it doesn’t start too soon.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Alright, I’m here. Let me see... Wow, this is a <em>lot</em> of people. Oh, there they are. I see Donald Knuth sitting right behind us, many other names that I can’t recognize or see well. Should be starting soo...
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
<strong>WHAT</strong>; I’m not wearing any pants. It’s not like I’m fully naked, but I only have underwear on. Bright green underwear with flowers on it. <em>This isn’t even my underwear</em>. What the fuck. How did I enter here with no one noticing? I swear I remember how I walked in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Jame is wearing something of a long sweatshirt. Maybe I could just pull an ancient Roman and tie it around my waist, so I have something of a kilt, something to cover the bright acid green panties (not even boxers?) that I’m wearing right now in the middle of a tech conference.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
“Hey, listen, Jame,” I said quietly not to interrupt anything going on around us. “Could you loan me your sweatshirt? Promise I’ll give it back when we’re out of here.” I think he noticed that I’m not wearing any paints.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
ALl of the sudden, he exclaimed, <strong>“YOU WERE GOATED AND NOW PANTLESS!”</strong> Well, you don’t have to yell that out loud. Wait, why did you yell that out loud? The whole audience of hundreds of people can hear you.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
<strong>“THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY LOL LMAO MONKAW”</strong>, he said so loud that I thought I would go deaf because of the sheer fucking embarassment.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Suddenly, a woman to Jame’s left and a man behind him stood up; they quickly escorted him out of the hall. All I saw in that moment was Ethan’s face of pure shock or joy. I couldn’t pinpoint which one it was exactly.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
I can’t stay here any longer. I’m pantless, naked, and afraid.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
“Yo, Ethan, let’s dip,” I said in a lower voice than Jame did.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
“Yeah, let’s go.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
I was walking down the hallway, still just in my underwear. Time to leave. I opened the door, it’s freezing cold. Is it winter again? The roads are all snowy; it’s hailing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
To my right I see Ethan carrying Jame on his back. I wonder why. Jame definitely doesn’t look too happy. I think I saw him being kinda grumpy in the hallway when we were leaving.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Huh, was the conference here in Burge Union? That’s not too far away from Towers. I just need to cross the road.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
I fell. I’m in the middle of the crosswalk on my fours and I can’t stand up. It’s freezing. I’m starting to lose any kind of sensations from my limbs and fingers. This isn’t good.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Okay, by some miracle I found my way into Towers on my floor.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Why are my drawers outside? They’re just on the floor right outside of the apartment door. Why are the drawers open? Who are those girls ravaging through it?
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
“Hi, I don’t really like my clothes and drawers be all open in public,” I said in a midst of a pure confusion.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
“Oh, don’t worry, we can go through it together,” the cute girl with interesting tattoos said to me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Thinking of it, why do we need to go through me clothes?
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
I asked for her name, it was May or Maya. Probably May.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
It’s late and I’m cold. I entered the apartment, entered my bedroom.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph " >
<p>
Huh, it’s morning? We are national champions now. Classes are not cancelled?
</p>
