* I write 🥂

Well, I graduated. Woohoo! 🥳 Over the years, I wrote many different articles,
essays, and random musings; it was fun. A realization came to me -- there are
some pieces I have that are too big for a blog, nor are they stories. Please
enjoy some of my longer writings below. I intend to continue writing something
more intriguing, flashier, and more *flamboyant*! 🎇💥⚡️

** ♥️ The Ideal of Love in /Brothers Karamazov/

What does it mean to love someone? This is the question I asked myself many
times over my own life with its tried and failed attempts at love. Fatefully,
one summer, I discovered /Brothers Karamazov/ by Fyodor Dostoevsky, which
reinvented the many ways I used to perceive what life has to offer. Standing
here, I realize what a transitional experience it has been for many people who
have had the pleasure and struggle to enter Dostoevsky’s mind in what has been
acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature. One of the
essential factors in this moral transformation is discussing the true nature of
love. I am interested in researching the following question – “What is the ideal
of love for Dostoevsky in /Brothers Karamazov/?”

** ♠️ Politeness is Dead

This is a sociolinguistic study of how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory][Politeness theory]] applies to Nikolai
Gogol's /Dead Souls/; and what we can learn about how we interact with each
other. I worked with [[https://slavic.ku.edu/marta-kapszewicz][Marta Kapszewicz]]; I couldn't have asked for a better
partner. As a running gag in the graduate course taught by [[https://mlg.ku.edu][Marc L. Greenberg]], I
was called /Marta II/ and Marta was /Marta III/. ``Who is /Marta I/?'' you might ask.
Well, that is for the select few to know. This was a fascinating project to work
on; interestingly enough, it takes its roots in Japanese forms of politeness and
social codes. Join us in exploring how we can reason about those concepts both
qualitatively and quantitatively! This inspection will allow us to grasp the
foundation of human communication and language as a sharp instrument.

** ♣️ The Star with No Name

Did you know Romania has a railway line between Bucharest and Sinaia, a mountain
resort popular with high society thanks to its gambling and hotel scene? An
express train hurriedly runs from its point of departure to its
destination. Passengers on the train are either excited to get a lucky gambling
streak at a casino or return to business as usual. Interestingly, none of the
people on board would know a small provincial town on the railway. But we also
must ask ourselves, how would they know? It’s not like the train ever bothers to
stop there. This paper will compare the original play from 1944 by Mihail
Sebastian, /The Star with no Name/, and the Soviet film adaptation directed by
Mikhail Kozakov, /Nameless Star/.
