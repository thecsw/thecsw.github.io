* About 🤔
*Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website*
  
I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my home
on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes, webpage
updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like [[http://burger.com][burger.com]] and
[[http://fmboschetto.it][fmboschetto.it]]. Maybe more people will try to have their own website that
allows them to modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!
  
I have some presence on the web, you can find me around here
