* About 🤔

Call me Sandy. Some moons ago - no clue how or when exactly - having no
last-minute assignments left to do, and projects in particular to obsess with, I
thought I would make a simple website and explore the world of blogging. It is a
way I use to interact with the world, and expressing myself. Whenever I find
myself needing to share something; whenever it is good a time, revolutionary
March in my soul; whenever I find myself trying out new tech; and especially
whenever my curiosity overshadows the other me, that it requires an Aristotlian
virtue to prevent me from sinking all my time, and methodically ignoring every
other commitment in life - then, I consider it to be moment of truth. This is my
substitute for the internet.
