*Hey, everyone! This is Sandy. Welcome to my website*

I don't really use facebook™ or MySpace, so this webpage is kind of my
home on the internet now. I do my online articles here, weekly quotes,
webpage updates, the good stuff, etc. I really enjoy having a personal
website. There is something profound about Web 1.0, like
http://burger.com[burger.com] and http://fmboschetto.it[fmboschetto.it].
Maybe more people will try to have their own website that allows them to
modify it in any conceivable way. Please enjoy!

I have some presence on the web, you can find me around here
