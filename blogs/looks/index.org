* What do I look like ðŸ¤³

93; 12022 H.E.

I never intended for my website or persona on the internet to be hidden or
anonymized. The online appearance I keep is pretty mainstream, yet predominantly
isolated to sandyuraz.com. I have my real pictures scattered around from
different platforms I used to have; allow me to share some pictures.

NOTE: Added a new (new) picture on March 1st, 2023! Gotten older.
