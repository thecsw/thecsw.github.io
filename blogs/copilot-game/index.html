This morning while at work, I received an email from Github, letting me know that I got access to Copilot‚Äôs technical preview. Of course, I immediately dropped everything in order to play with this shiny new toy I just got.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I played with it a little bit in different languages with my friends, trying to create functions over some of our custom classes or structs we made on the fly. Overall, I must say, it‚Äôs pretty impressive how it can pick up the surrounding context and write boilerplate code on it (maybe not always fully correct).
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Then sometime later in the afternoon, I pulled up an empty python file and just wrote <code>def start(</code>, where copilot picked it from and immediately started writing down print statements, for what it seems to be a simple text-based adventure game. I tab-completed the whole game and it actually ran!
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
This is just a small experiment seeing how it picked up this specific example from whatever is its (controversial) training set. I recorded the game writing, where all I do is give the original start signature (this was my second attempt, so I gave it <code>def start(self):</code> to nudge copilot into giving me what I had right before) and just pressing tabs.

You can get the python file <a href="start.py">here</a>.

Some very quick searching showed that this is apparently an exercise from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> by Zed Shaw, more specifically, <a href="https://gist.github.com/blammothyst/9258449">exercise #35</a>. It feels as many people posted their take on this exercise from the book or some specific implementation got a prime spot in the training set and is later suggested first when evaluating.

This is my ~7th hour since I started playing with copilot, so I wanted to share some cool findings and observations when playing with it. Will it replace all software engineers? Probably not, as a good engineer is not simply a code writer of various algorithms, one has to understand the big picture and work top-to-bottom. Will I use copilot? I don‚Äôt know. It works well for JS plotting and matplotlib plotting, because I could never care less to remember d3 methods to get me a 3d pie chart.  <b style="color:#ba3925">‚óºÔ∏é</b>
