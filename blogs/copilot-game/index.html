<p>This morning while at work, I received an email from Github, letting me
know that I got access to Copilot&#8217;s technical preview. Of course, I
immediately dropped everything in order to play with this shiny new toy
I just got.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I played with it a little bit in different languages with my friends,
trying to create functions over some of our custom classes or structs we
made on the fly. Overall, I must say, it&#8217;s pretty impressive how it can
pick up the surrounding context and write boilerplate code on it (maybe
not always fully correct).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then sometime later in the afternoon, I pulled up an empty python file
and just wrote <code>def start(</code>, where copilot picked it from and
immediately started writing down print statements, for what it seems to
be a simple text-based adventure game. I tab-completed the whole game
and it actually ran!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just a small experiment seeing how it picked up this specific
example from whatever is its (controversial) training set. I recorded
the game writing, where all I do is give the original start signature
(this was my second attempt, so I gave it <code>def start(self):</code> to nudge
copilot into giving me what I had right before) and just pressing tabs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can get the python file <a href="./start.py">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some very quick searching showed that this is apparently an exercise
from
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914">Learn
Python the Hard Way</a> by Zed Shaw, more specifically,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/blammothyst/9258449">exercise #35</a>. It feels as
many people posted their take on this exercise from the book or some
specific implementation got a prime spot in the training set and is
later suggested first when evaluating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is my ~7th hour since I started playing with copilot, so I wanted
to share some cool findings and observations when playing with it. Will
it replace all software engineers? Probably not, as a good engineer is
not simply a code writer of various algorithms, one has to understand
the big picture and work top-to-bottom. Will I use copilot? I don&#8217;t
know. It works well for JS plotting and matplotlib plotting, because I
could never care less to remember d3 methods to get me a 3d pie chart.
