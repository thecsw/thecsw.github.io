* It's all one üçû

287; 12022 H.E.

I ask myself on what is evil and good. What separates those two? Across
generations of poetry, thoughts, and religion, those two have been at each other
for as long as time can remember. We always imagine the evil working as a
corrupting force on people -- bringing their fall upon them. All in while the
forces of good are actively battling those Machiavellian-like creatures. It's
all exciting, almost like an action movie, where you can side with one or the
other and root for them. What a narrow-minded way of thinking this is.

In actuality, those scary creatures we like to root against are simply mirrors
of our own darker selves. The good and evil are the not the great opposing
powers that are in a constant state of war -- they are two side of the same
coin. Simply put, it's all one. We need both of them. One without the other
impoverishes our souls. When all good with no nothing in between, we lose the
taste of life. This is the complicated nature of man, which would ruin Heaven
when it gets boring. On the contrary, all evil is caricature-esque and
impossible, when there is no good to define or oppose it.

Our hearts have both the greatness and the misery in them. Those two existing
next to each other fulfills us as humans, pushes us to evolve -- in one way or
the other. The fact of that is not bad nor good. It is us. We are defined by the
complex universe that is our soul. Many ask, why do bad things happen to good
people? How God can permit such disasters occuring to his Children?

/Book of Job/ is the classical route for the thought of why God permits evil. The
great forces of all we think we know are in on it together. The downfall of a
man or his ascendance are brought in by the same force that lets humanity go
through the spiral-like ladder of life. To be even more pedantic, there might
not even be good or evil -- it all just is.

I bet it's great to wake up in the morning and pick a side that you're
on. ``Everything that's not on my side is my foe, therefore I shall go against
them.'' It probably takes a great deal of humility and sincere vulnerability in
one's beliefs to understand the combative nature of thinking we've been taught
to live with. If that really is living. Maybe just existing and having something
or someone to blame for your own misfortunes. ``Oh, it's the devil's doings.''

I am poor, but... I won‚Äôt say very honest, but... it‚Äôs an axiom gener- ally
accepted in society that I am a fallen angel. I certainly can‚Äôt conceive how I
can ever have been an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so long ago that
there‚Äôs no harm in forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a
gentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I love
men genuinely, I‚Äôve been greatly calumniated! [...]

It reminds of /Brothers Karamazov/, which in many ways is the foundational text of
my life. What I have been before and after are two separate ways. I
digress. In the story, Ivan is intellectually brilliant, an atheist with a
dictum, ``if there is no God, everything is lawful'' that defines the motif of
the entire novel. In arguments with his younger brother, Alyosha, who never
received a formal education, a novice in the local Orthodox monastery -- Ivan
completely overwhelms him with superb points against the existence of God. Where
Alyosha is overwhelmed to the point of a complete loss in countering or coming
back at his brother. Still, in all of this, Alyosha is the better man.

Let us live freely. Break down the chains of the mind and the traps of the
brain. Liberate ourselves from forced fears and dreads. We do not live in good
or bad times, they just are. We live day to day and how perceive them is fully
reliant on our emotions and conscious. At whatever moment of life we find
ourselves in, let us be in it and accept what we have. The universe is ruled by
letting things take their course. It cannot be ruled by interfering.
