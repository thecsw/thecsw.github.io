Ah yes, I graduated! Now seems as good as ever -- it has been a long time coming
🚀 What a feeling this is 💥

The four years encapsulated the most foundational time and experience that guide
me daily 🥂Thank you, The University of Kansas, for nurturing us in your nest,
consisting of our peers, faculty, and friends 🪺☀️

University of Kansas - School of Engineering, it's been my honor and pleasure to
serve as the master of ceremonies for the Engineering Recognition Ceremony 🏍

Fellow graduates and current students; We shall continue living, breathing, and
most of all — having fun in the new exciting endeavors! 🍾🥂

To play off the parting musings of my graduation farewell speech 👇

--- (•◡•) /

Never forget about the compassion of your friends and the support of your
families that got you here. It is our turn to welcome the new generation and
pass the torch of the youth. It is time for a new chapter — a new life.

Today marks the day we have to spread our wings — full of courage and hope — and
march into the future that awaits.

Let me ask you, are you ready to live?
