* Sakura Train and me 🌸
In the brief happy periods that I get to reunite with my besto friendo who had
just visited me, here, in the land that he had moved away from in pursuit of
greatness, he nerd-sniped me with a /rolife/ building set---oh boy I [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/mini-library/][love]]
those---where after grueling four or five hours, when I found myself awake at
three in the morning on a weekday, still building it, let me introduce you,
my dear reader, to some pictures I took.

My satisfaction with the pictures I've taken recently has been somewhat
varied. I think I had reached a point due to multiple growing pains; the first
one is my /13 mini/ dying on me in real time, glitching, freezing, and losing my
what I thought to be perfect shots. And the other is trying to find and play
with different styles and feelings I want to convey in my photos, so it's a work
in progress.

Giving the /Sakura Train/ a little LED strip inside was such a nice touch by the
designer of the kit. Taking some pictures right after I had finished building it
gave some strong /Spirited Away/ vibes.

How about we take the train home? It should be here soon.
