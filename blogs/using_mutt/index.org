* Bring joy back to email with Mutt 🐕

May 13th, 2019

** Abstract
"Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of
exchanging messages ("mail") between people using electronic devices.
Invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s
and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email."
[fn::Taken directly from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email][Wikipedia]]] Email has been around for more
than 50 years now. As we go further on our timeline, folks from new
generations are starting to forget the beauty of email. This article
will discuss the problems with the current state of emails and the ways
to bring back joy into it.

** Problems with modern email
When you ask someone to check their email, I am sure they would rather
use their phone if they do not have one open already on their computer.
The reason for this is the discomfort people have opening their email
services in their browsers. The key for this discomfort is time. When I
open my email on my laptop, it takes about 5-6 seconds to just open my
browser, 2-3 more seconds to enter the email address, and God knows how
much longer until my inbox actually opens. Looking at you, Gmail.

People want their services to work fast and without any delays. Phones
have apps that open and become operational with just a tap of a finger.
However, phone apps are not very extensive in their functionality
(attaching files, sorting mail, flagging email, bulk delete) and they do
not offer a full range of formatting tools. By all means, they never had
to, they are just expected to perform the most basic options.

Due to all the convenience that mobile apps offer, people choose to use
it all the time instead of full clients, therefore limiting the number
of actions they can make. They just reserve themselves to most basic
functionality. Which is very and very unfortunate. Instead of
progressing and learning new tools and better ways to perform tasks,
users prefer to stick to what they know. This is not only an email
problem, it is a general issue with most if not all technologies.

In reality, email is a fantastic way of communication. Indeed, it was
the /only/ way to communicate over the Internet back in 1970s and 1980s.
As the time progresses and we create our future, developers around the
world tried to work on email clients and unfortunately made them more
unintuitive and less user-friendly. This beautiful way of communication
became this big hassle of navigating to intermediate apps and typing a
message.

Is there a solution for this unfortunate turn of events and
overcomplication of email technology? I wish to introduce you to =Mutt=
email client that brings back joy and happiness into emailing each
other.

** What is Mutt?
[[http://www.mutt.org/][Mutt]] is a text-based email client developed by
Michael Elkins in 1995 for UNIX-like systems. I want to say that this is
truly the way emails were meant to be used. Before I start getting angry
emails, I am aware of other fantastic =TUI= and =ncurses= email clients,
such as: [[http://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]], [[http://www.instinct.org/elm/][Elm]], and [[http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/][Alpine]] (Used by Brian
Kernighan!). However, it is safe to say that =Mutt= is the most
extensive, feature-rich, actively developed, and well-supported by its
community. Just to list some of its features, please take a look at the
excerpt from Mutt's website below:

- color support
- active development community
- full control of message headers when composing
- highly customizable, including keybindings and macros
- postpone message composition indefinetly for later recall
- easily include attachments when composing, even from the command line
- easy to install (uses GNU autoconf)
- translation into at least 20 languages
- small and efficient
- /It's free!/ (no cost and GPL'ed)
- and so [[http://www.mutt.org/][much more!]]

=Mutt= accompanied with =offlineimap= will allow you to have all your
emails saved on your machine so you will have a 24/7 access to them even
if you do not have internet connection. You can write an email and
postpone it indefinitely until your internet connection comes back. It
also takes 0.1 seconds to boot it up and start composing a message. Do
not forget about the aesthetics and romance with the terminal. Let us
talk about the actual setup and what you have to do to be happy with
your email experience.

** IMAP and SMTP protocols 
As you might know, email service in itself is relaying on several layers
of protocols to retrieve and send mail. There is also POP3 protocol
similar to IMAP. I will not discuss the differences between them, but I
can assure you that IMAP is always a better choice as it is more
organized in its nature. Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP is
used to retrieve all email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP
connection. This is the protocol we will use to download all our
messages and store them locally. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP
is used for sending messages and handling remote mail server message
transferring.

You can imagine that =Mutt= email client will rely on both of the
protocols to operate normally. And you will be right. =offlineimap= is a
program that allows us to use IMAP protocol and store all messages
directly on our machine. There is also an option where you could use
=Mutt= without =offlineimap=, it would mean that everytime you want to
open your mailbox, Mutt will contact your mail server to download list
of your messages. This is a very time expensive operation as it greatly
depends on your bandwidth, internet location, and physical location from
the mail server. Also, it would not allow you to access your messages
without a constant internet connection. For this article, I will include
full =offlineimap= configuration before we start using =Mutt=.

** offlineimap 

*** Installation

If you are using one of the bigger Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora,
Debian, and etc), it should already be installed. Try runnig
=% offlineimap= to see if you have an active executable.

NOTE: =%= indicates that we are in the terminal. Everything after =%=
should be executed.

If you do not have it installed, you can run
=% sudo pacman -S offlineimap= on Arch Linux to install it or use python
package manager [[https://pypi.org/project/pip/][pip]] to install it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% pip install --user offlineimap
#+END_SRC

That should get you a fresh copy of =offlineimap=.

*** Configuration

=offlineimap= as a UNIX application, uses a configuration file,
conveniently called =.offlineimaprc=. To make things easier, touch the
file in your home directory or open your favorite tex editor, /emacs/,
and write down the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
~/.offlineimaprc
----------------
[general]
metadata = ~/.offlineimap
# You can change mymail to something else
accounts = mymail
socktimeout = 60

[Account mymail]
localrepository = local-mymail
remoterepository = remote-mymail

[Repository local-mymail]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/.mail/mymail

[Repository remote-mymail]
type = IMAP
remotehost = imap.site.com # edit this
remoteuser = myusername # edit this
remotepass = mypassword # edit this
ssl = yes
realdelete = no
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
#+END_EXAMPLE

This config file just gives us some details about how to contact the
IMAP server and how to save it. =_mymail_= is any name of your choice.
For my university mail, I have it named =kumail=, feel free to name it
whatever name is convenient for you.

Local Repository gives info where it store all our email data, that
would be =.mail/_mymail_= directory in your home directory. Remote
repository is a bit more trickier but not difficult. It just specifies
what you mail server is. Find your IMAP server, ports are not really
important because they are usually the default ones (993). For example,
my university has its IMAP server on imap.ku.edu. Username and password
should be pretty obvious.

*** Syncing your mailbox

Just run the command below to synchronize your email server and your
local mailbox.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% offlineimap
#+END_SRC

It will take a while to run this command for the first time because it
has to download /everything/. Depending on your mailbox size, it may
take a non-trivial time. Just be patient and let it do the magic for
you. It is also a good advice for life. Just live the best you can, it
will play itself out in the best way possible. Also, a little bit of
faith always helps.

With this, we should be ready to comfortably start configuring our new
email client.

** Mutt and NeoMutt

So far, we talked about =Mutt=, but there is also a fork of it (same
software with more features), called =NeoMutt=. We will be using it
instead of =Mutt= as it is more extensible, faster, and
backward-compatible with =Mutt=. You have same configuration files for
both of them.

*** Installation

Installation of =NeoMutt= is super straight forward. Just pick your
favorite flavor of Linux and install a package called =neomutt=. For
Arch Linux, it just would be

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% sudo pacman -S neomutt
#+END_SRC

Consult with the [[https://neomutt.org/distro.html][official downloads page]] for a list of the biggest distributions
and how to install package on them.

*** Configuration

For the sake of brevity, I will brake down the configuration into
multiple chunks. Firstly, I will talk about basic installation just to
get a barebone version working, securing your password, and best of them
all, making it super colorful, with signatures, ANSI escape sequences,
and other cool stuff.

**** Basic config

Just to get you started, the drill is the same as the last time, but now
it would be called =~/.muttrc= The config file has a lot of different
entries, so to keep it short, I will include the config file and it will
be an exercise for the reader to get the meaning of the entries (this
will be simple, I promise).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# This should go to ~/.muttrc
# Set up all the folders
set folder="~/.mail/mymail"
mailboxes = +INBOX
mailboxes = +'Sent Items'
mailboxes = +'Deleted Items'
set spoolfile = +INBOX
set trash = +'Deleted Items'
set postponed = +'Drafts'
set record = +'Sent Items'

# Sort by reverse date
set sleep_time = 0
set sort = 'reverse-date'

# Default sending charset
set send_charset="utf-8"

# SMTP FOR SENDING EMAIL
set realname="Big Lebowski" # edit this
set my_user=myusername # edit this
set my_pass=mypassword # edit this
set from = myaddress@example.com # edit this
set smtp_url=smtp://$my_user:$my_pass@authsmtp.site.com:587 # edit this

# Sending mail options
set edit_headers=yes
set use_from = yes
set fast_reply=yes
set include=no

# SSL options
set ssl_force_tls = yes
set ssl_starttls = yes

# Default text editor
set editor = $EDITOR

# Ways to open the mail messages
auto_view text/html
alternative_order text/plain text/html

# Headers
my_hdr X-Info: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
my_hdr X-Operating-System: `uname -s`, kernel `uname -r`
my_hdr User-Agent: Every email client sucks, this one just sucks less.

set markers = no
set mark_old = no

set forward_format = "Fwd: %s"       # format of subject when forwarding
set forward_decode                   # decode when forwarding
set forward_quote                    # include message in forwards
set reverse_name                     # reply as whomever it was to
#set include                          # include message in replies

auto_view text/html
auto_view application/pgp-encrypted
alternative_order text/plain text/enriched text/html
set rfc2047_parameters = yes

# Date and index formatting styles
set date_format="%m-%d-%y %T"
set index_format="%2C | %Z [%d] %-30.30F (%-4.4c) %s"# -*-muttrc-*-
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can easily leave everything as it is, just edit all the lines with
=# edit this=. Please pay a close attention to the line
=set smtp_url...=. You have to find your SMTP server address and port
number (usually 587). After that, your email should be operational!

*** Make it cool

**** Secure password

You might not like that we store your password in plain text in your
=~/.muttrc=. I do not like it either. In this section, we will encrypt
your email password and only you should be able te unlock it. We will
encrypt your password with GPG. To do so, you have to have a pair of
keys: public and private. To read more about public and private key
encryption, visit its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography][Wikipedia page.]]

We will make you a pair of your own encryption keys to store your
password in a very very secure way.

***** Generating pair of keys 

The following command will get you through everything

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% gpg --gen-key
#+END_SRC

Make a new directory in your home directory with =% mkdir ~/.mutt=

***** Creating password file

You have to create your password with
=% echo set my_pass = '_mypassword_' > ~/.mutt/mypass=

IMPORTANT: Put a space before the command so your system will not save
your plain text password in its shell history.

Encrypt the file with =% gpg -r _my_email_ -e ~/.mutt/mypass=, where
=_my_email_= is the email address you used when you created your key.
You will have a new file called =mypass.gpg= that is your actual
encrypted password.

You can decrypt it and get the contents with
=% gpg -d ~/.mutt/mypass.gpg=

Remove the old file with =% rm mypass=

***** Add key to Mutt 

Add the following line to the top of your =~/.muttrc=:
=source "gpg -dq $HOME/.mutt/mypass.gpg |"=

Now, you can get rid of the plain text password from your =~/.muttrc=
and you are done! Try opening NeoMutt, it should ask you for your gpg
password if you set up one.

**** Add your signature

Make your signature in the =~/.mutt/mysig.sig=, for example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
~/.mutt/mysig.sig
-----------------
Jack Bauer

Director of C.T.U.
Don't call me
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add the line below to include your signature in every new email message.
=set signature = "$HOME/.mutt/mysig.sig"=

**** Encrypting your emails

If you are feeling dangerous, you can start signing your emails,
encrypting them, armored signatures, and other cool stuff. To do that,
download link:./gpg.rc[this file], add that to your =~/.mutt/=
directory, create one if you don't have it, and add the following line
to your =~/.muttrc=: =source ~/.mutt/gpg.rc=

Press =p= when composing email to see the available options.

**** Read web pages in your email

Download link:./mailcap[this file], move the file to the =~/.mutt/=
directory, add this line to your configuration file
=set mailcap_path = ~/.mutt/mailcap=

**** Make it corolful

Make your NeoMutt look really good. Same drill.

Download link:./color.mutt[this file], move the file to the =~/.mutt/=
directory, add this line to your configuration file
=source $HOME/.mutt/color.mutt=

** Conclusion

/MAKE EMAIL GREAT AGAIN/
