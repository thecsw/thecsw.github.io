"Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages
("mail") between people using electronic devices. Invented by Ray
Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the
mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email." <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> Email has
been around for more than 50 years now. As we go further on our
timeline, folks from new generations are starting to forget the beauty
of email. This article will discuss the problems with the current state
of emails and the ways to bring back joy into it.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you ask someone to check their email, I am sure they would rather
use their phone if they do not have one open already on their computer.
The reason for this is the discomfort people have opening their email
services in their browsers. The key for this discomfort is time. When I
open my email on my laptop, it takes about 5-6 seconds to just open my
browser, 2-3 more seconds to enter the email address, and God knows how
much longer until my inbox actually opens. Looking at you, Gmail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People want their services to work fast and without any delays. Phones
have apps that open and become operational with just a tap of a finger.
However, phone apps are not very extensive in their functionality
(attaching files, sorting mail, flagging email, bulk delete) and they do
not offer a full range of formatting tools. By all means, they never had
to, they are just expected to perform the most basic options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to all the convenience that mobile apps offer, people choose to use
it all the time instead of full clients, therefore limiting the number
of actions they can make. They just reserve themselves to most basic
functionality. Which is very and very unfortunate. Instead of
progressing and learning new tools and better ways to perform tasks,
users prefer to stick to what they know. This is not only an email
problem, it is a general issue with most if not all technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, email is a fantastic way of communication. Indeed, it was
the <em>only</em> way to communicate over the Internet back in 1970s and 1980s.
As the time progresses and we create our future, developers around the
world tried to work on email clients and unfortunately made them more
unintuitive and less user-friendly. This beautiful way of communication
became this big hassle of navigating to intermediate apps and typing a
message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is there a solution for this unfortunate turn of events and
overcomplication of email technology? I wish to introduce you to <code>Mutt</code>
email client that brings back joy and happiness into emailing each
other.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_is_mutt">What is Mutt?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> is a text-based email client developed by
Michael Elkins in 1995 for UNIX-like systems. I want to say that this is
truly the way emails were meant to be used. Before I start getting angry
emails, I am aware of other fantastic <code>TUI</code> and <code>ncurses</code> email clients,
such as: <a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a>, <a href="http://www.instinct.org/elm/">Elm</a>,
and <a href="http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/">Alpine</a> (Used by Brian
Kernighan!). However, it is safe to say that <code>Mutt</code> is the most
extensive, feature-rich, actively developed, and well-supported by its
community. Just to list some of its features, please take a look at the
excerpt from Mutt&#8217;s website below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>color support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>active development community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>full control of message headers when composing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>highly customizable, including keybindings and macros</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>postpone message composition indefinetly for later recall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>easily include attachments when composing, even from the command line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>easy to install (uses GNU autoconf)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>translation into at least 20 languages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>small and efficient</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s free!</em> (no cost and GPL&#8217;ed)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Mutt</code> accompanied with <code>offlineimap</code> will allow you to have all your
emails saved on your machine so you will have a 24/7 access to them even
if you do not have internet connection. You can write an email and
postpone it indefinitely until your internet connection comes back. It
also takes 0.1 seconds to boot it up and start composing a message. Do
not forget about the aesthetics and romance with the terminal. Let us
talk about the actual setup and what you have to do to be happy with
your email experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_imap_and_smtp_protocols">IMAP and SMTP protocols</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you might know, email service in itself is relaying on several layers
of protocols to retrieve and send mail. There is also POP3 protocol
similar to IMAP. I will not discuss the differences between them, but I
can assure you that IMAP is always a better choice as it is more
organized in its nature. Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP is
used to retrieve all email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP
connection. This is the protocol we will use to download all our
messages and store them locally. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP
is used for sending messages and handling remote mail server message
transferring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can imagine that <code>Mutt</code> email client will rely on both of the
protocols to operate normally. And you will be right. <code>offlineimap</code> is a
program that allows us to use IMAP protocol and store all messages
directly on our machine. There is also an option where you could use
<code>Mutt</code> without <code>offlineimap</code>, it would mean that everytime you want to
open your mailbox, Mutt will contact your mail server to download list
of your messages. This is a very time expensive operation as it greatly
depends on your bandwidth, internet location, and physical location from
the mail server. Also, it would not allow you to access your messages
without a constant internet connection. For this article, I will include
full <code>offlineimap</code> configuration before we start using <code>Mutt</code>.</p>

<h3 id="_installation">Installation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using one of the bigger Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora,
Debian, and etc), it should already be installed. Try runnig
<code>% offlineimap</code> to see if you have an active executable.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not have it installed, you can run
<code>% sudo pacman -S offlineimap</code> on Arch Linux to install it or use python
package manager <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> to install it.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_configuration">Configuration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>offlineimap</code> as a UNIX application, uses a configuration file,
conveniently called <code>.offlineimaprc</code>. To make things easier, touch the
file in your home directory or open your favorite tex editor, <em>emacs</em>,
and write down the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-example" data-lang="example">~/.offlineimaprc

[general]
metadata = ~/.offlineimap
# You can change mymail to something else
accounts = mymail
socktimeout = 60

[Account mymail]
localrepository = local-mymail
remoterepository = remote-mymail

[Repository local-mymail]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/.mail/mymail

[Repository remote-mymail]
type = IMAP
remotehost = imap.site.com # edit this
remoteuser = myusername # edit this
remotepass = mypassword # edit this
ssl = yes
realdelete = no
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This config file just gives us some details about how to contact the
IMAP server and how to save it. <code><em>mymail</em></code> is any name of your choice.
For my university mail, I have it named <code>kumail</code>, feel free to name it
whatever name is convenient for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Local Repository gives info where it store all our email data, that
would be <code>.mail/<em>mymail</em></code> directory in your home directory. Remote
repository is a bit more trickier but not difficult. It just specifies
what you mail server is. Find your IMAP server, ports are not really
important because they are usually the default ones (993). For example,
my university has its IMAP server on imap.ku.edu. Username and password
should be pretty obvious.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_syncing_your_mailbox">Syncing your mailbox</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just run the command below to synchronize your email server and your

<p>It will take a while to run this command for the first time because it
has to download <em>everything</em>. Depending on your mailbox size, it may
take a non-trivial time. Just be patient and let it do the magic for
you. It is also a good advice for life. Just live the best you can, it
will play itself out in the best way possible. Also, a little bit of
faith always helps.</p>
