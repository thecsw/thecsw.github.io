* My Spotify Wrapped for 2021 ðŸŽ§

4; 12022 H.E.

Good morning! It's been a while since I posted anything in the random section. I
talked [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/song_challenge/][briefly]] in the [[https://sandyuraz.com/arts/][past]] about my music tastes and what kind of music I listen
to. I must confess, 12021 has been quite rough in some spots, which affected my
taste and playlists in somewhat of a major way. What's the better way to recap
it than using the new handy-dandy [[https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/][Spotify wrapped]] that sums up everything you
did on the platform for the entire year. Let's jump in!

Let's start with some bare stats. According to the wrap, in total, I spent
11,183 minutes (â‰ˆ186 hours) listening, which is more than 60% of other listeners
in United States. Pretty cool stat, I feel this is the right number. I also
spent an absurd amount of time looping songs on youtube, but that's not tracked.

Going next to my top song! It's *NIGHT RUNNING* by /Shin Sakiura/ and /AAAMYYY/. They
say it looped 79 times, which seems to be a rather low number, but that's okay.
It has a kick. I watched [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNA%3A_Brand_New_Animal][BNA]] with my sister and absolutely loved it. So the
ending song became my go-to programming jam. I'll have spotify embeds sprinkled
around this page.

Besides the very top one, what other songs have I had on repeat that crawled
themselves to my top songs list?

Coming in second, *Vitality* by /Mittsies/. Loved [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/][Helltaker]] and the main soundtrack
would just blast in my apartment for an entire week non-stop, even when I wasn't
home. There is just something about sharply-dressed demon girls and a top-down
2D puzzle game with amazing character design. The game is actually free! It was
so good, I bought the pancake recipe to support [[https://twitter.com/vanripperart][vanripper]] for the game he made.

Moving in and out is always a bit of a stressful and *lonely* experience. I
remember I had to move into a new apartment and I was just by myself after
spending some quality time with my family. Loving Evangelion and everything
associated with it, I would play *Misato* theme by /Shiro Sagisu/. It made me feel
less lonely and more upbeat, instantly cozying up the atmosphere. I was at home.

Well, what can I say about playing *Fly Me To the Moon*, the Evangelion version? I
actually prefer it to Frank Sinatra's version, simply because, like man, anime
music just hits *different*. This one has such a calming and a warm hug kind of a
feeling. It's something that's just history now.

[[https://open.spotify.com/track/6o97UuQmaxccF95fdt9PPR][spotify track]]

Last but not least. *What A Life* by /Scarlet Pleasure/. If you haven't seen [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Round_(film)][Another
Round]] with /Mads Mikkelsen/, well, highly highly recommend it. I've always had a
beef with American movies in how over-the-top they go or simply tend to
trivialize many topics. Comedies feel tragic and tragedies feel comedic. It
shouldn't feel like that. Largely, European cinematography has more subtlety to
their soul and it feels. Carefully treading the themes of alcoholism and being
alive. The song is an *absolute banger* and I rarely say that about anything.

Other honorable mentions that go right after the top 5 are: [[https://open.spotify.com/track/4EkbGJChszyxhEP0bIwBSZ][Sorairo Days]] by
/Shoko Nagawa/ (Gurren Lagann), [[https://open.spotify.com/track/0DI3WNmIyfi2GZLQwhYDQC][Komm, sÃ¼sser Tod]] (Evangelion), [[https://open.spotify.com/track/0oCP1Vu9LGVP88atKzOswC][ambiguous]] (Kill la
Kill), [[https://open.spotify.com/track/3eltl3hwhMakKmc2K7flgY][Ready To]] (BNA), [[https://open.spotify.com/track/7olMFQZhjN2EHf7ra2PjE7][Fly Away]] by /TeddyLoid/ (Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt),
and more! You can see the whole top playlist below

Let's do a vibe check on my music taste. What kind of an aura do I have? It's
*dramatic* and *considerate*. Well said, I like the colors

What about genres? The stats say I listened to 32 different genres this year and
my top genres are

- Anime
- Classical piano
- Cool jazz
- Bossa nova
- Icelandic indie

*nice*

In addition, I listened to 404 (insert a =NOT FOUND= jape here) different
artists. Due to my sheer obsession with =Neon Genesis Evangelion=, my top artist
was /Shiro Sagisu/. I'm in his top 3% of listeners this year Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
