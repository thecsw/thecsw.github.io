* Why use emojis? ðŸŽ·ðŸ•º

March 15th, 2020

If you visited my website, you probably have noticed some number of emojis I
have put up almost everywhere. I like to send emojis via tex messages and post
statuses with them. Many ask me, *why?*

My first argument would be is that they are fun. Surely, most of my friends and
current adolescents might see them as cringey and overused. They have a valid
point too. I use emojis thanks to light-hearted feeling they have and a bit of
goofiness sprinkled on top of it. It's just fun to send someone three dancing
ladies ðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ in good faith and just let it go. No explanation needed, that's
the whole point of those colorfully encoded unicode characters. However, my
biggest reason for using them would be the emotional impact I'm trying make in a
text medium. 

Text is a terrible way to communicate. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge believer
in texts and written communication. Look back at the times when Empires and Anna
Karenina style of love was popular. [[http://www.pushkins-poems.com/Yev311.htm][Tatyana's Letter]], probably the most
romantic and heartbreaking piece of literature, ever. It was a norm to write
heavy letters. Technology wasn't really developed with quick UDP and TCP packets
flying across the world that reassemble at the host. It would take weeks, maybe
months for a letter to reach its destination, or not. People's emotions would
bottle up during while waiting and when the time comes, they can be splashed
onto a piece of paper. The receiving party would feel the content, simply due
to its length and the seriousness of emotions of that time. 

Our text communication is pretty quick now. It takes a couple of milliseconds
for a piece of data to fly across the world and reach the recipient. We got rid
of the wait time and now I can send so many [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Programming][Tao of Programming]] quotes that you
better watch out. Because of the text bandwidth we have now, I sometimes feel
that texts lost that value per word. To make clear, I'm in no way complaining
about the techonological marvels we achieved. Talking to each other over a
distance became so mundane and routine that we don't really think about it as
much. We read a text notification and swipe up. How many times you've sent
something and felt that you and your companion ended up with a horrible
misunderstanding.

Not much brainpower goes into analyzing the purpose and emotions of texts you
get. We all know how this medium sometimes bottlenecks true meanings. Emojis are
just tone setters. That is exactly what they're meant to be. Let the cringe go
away and embrace the goofiness. Live a little
