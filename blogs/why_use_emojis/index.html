<p>If you visited my website, you probably have noticed some number of
emojis I have put up almost everywhere. I like to send emojis via tex
messages and post statuses with them. Many ask me, <strong>why?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My first argument would be is that they are fun. Surely, most of my
friends and current adolescents might see them as cringey and overused.
They have a valid point too. I use emojis thanks to light-hearted
feeling they have and a bit of goofiness sprinkled on top of it. It&#8217;s
just fun to send someone three dancing ladies 💃💃💃 in good faith and just
let it go. No explanation needed, that&#8217;s the whole point of those
colorfully encoded unicode characters. However, my biggest reason for
using them would be the emotional impact I&#8217;m trying make in a text
medium.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text is a terrible way to communicate. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m a huge
believer in texts and written communication. Look back at the times when
Empires and Anna Karenina style of love was popular.
<a href="http://www.pushkins-poems.com/Yev311.htm">Tatyana&#8217;s Letter</a>, probably the
most romantic and heartbreaking piece of literature, ever. It was a norm
to write heavy letters. Technology wasn&#8217;t really developed with quick
UDP and TCP packets flying across the world that reassemble at the host.
It would take weeks, maybe months for a letter to reach its destination,
or not. People&#8217;s emotions would bottle up during while waiting and when
the time comes, they can be splashed onto a piece of paper. The
receiving party would feel the content, simply due to its length and the
seriousness of emotions of that time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our text communication is pretty quick now. It takes a couple of
milliseconds for a piece of data to fly across the world and reach the
recipient. We got rid of the wait time and now I can send so many
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Programming">Tao of Programming</a>
quotes that you better watch out. Because of the text bandwidth we have
now, I sometimes feel that texts lost that value per word. To make
clear, I&#8217;m in no way complaining about the techonological marvels we
achieved. Talking to each other over a distance became so mundane and
routine that we don&#8217;t really think about it as much. We read a text
notification and swipe up. How many times you&#8217;ve sent something and felt
that you and your companion ended up with a horrible misunderstanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not much brainpower goes into analyzing the purpose and emotions of
texts you get. We all know how this medium sometimes bottlenecks true
meanings. Emojis are just tone setters. That is exactly what they&#8217;re
meant to be. Let the cringe go away and embrace the goofiness. Live a
little
