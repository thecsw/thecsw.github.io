* My Alive 2007 ðŸ¤–

I went to a life-changing concert---well, a club---that gave me the closest
experience I could ever hope to get to Alive 2007. It's been almost a week since
then, but my calves and quads hurt pleasantly from all the jumping and dancing.

The start was a little slow, since we didn't know that we would have to
awkwardly stand through a one and a half hour long performance that could never
really hit. Nothing personally against the opener, but the vibes were
straightforward---everyone was waiting for /them/ to come.

None of us expected them to come out with the entire getup. The suits, the
helmets, even their LED strips across their bodies switched colors all across
the RGB range---sending all of us into an uncontrollable flow state of just
doing it one more time.

Thank you, Daft Punk. For all the memories of reaching the state of total
transcendence when listening to /Within/ alone in a dark room. For the memories of
the first bittersweet first love in the sea of /Something About Us/. For the
courage granted by the loop of file in /Infinity Repeating/. See you forever.
