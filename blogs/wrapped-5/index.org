* My Spotify Wrapped for 2025 🏎️

Wecome back. It is great seeing after all this time since our encounters [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped/][four
years ago]], and [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-2/][three years ago]], and [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-3/][two years ago]], and even [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-4/][last year]]---wait for
it---this year we will be doing the same! However, there will be a big
difference for the simple reason of that whenever I drive, it is my spotify that
gets connected to the car's infotainment system and my wife is the DJ, where I'm
not allowed to touch the music in any way, so, there has been a massive external influence
