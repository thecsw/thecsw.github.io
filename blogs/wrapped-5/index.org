* My Spotify Wrapped for 2025 🏎️

Wecome back. It is great seeing after all this time since our encounters [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped/][four
years ago]], and [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-2/][three years ago]], and [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-3/][two years ago]], and even [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-4/][last year]]---wait for
it---this year we will be doing the same! However, there will be a big
difference for the simple reason of that whenever I drive, it is my spotify that
gets connected to the car's infotainment system and my wife is the DJ, where I'm
not allowed to touch the music in any way, so, there has been a massive external
influence that shaped this year's /Wrapped/. Strap yourself in. #indiecore

Starting off with the basic stuff---I beat my last year's record of minutes
listened by almost 5,000 minutes. Woah. And thanks to my wife, my taste had
actually taken a walk outside and I have had the chance to finally branch out of
never-ending loop of anime soundtracks and Japanese alternative rock into more
``modern'' flavors of music.

This year's /Wrapped/ was a reimagining of what it could be, since last year's had
gotten so much backlash from using /too much/ AI, especially after laying off
large swaths of their staff. It was not a good look, since telling me that my
music taste is like ``/Mcbling Catwalk Pop/'' does not mean a single thing to
me---it was just lazy, which made the whole fiasco rather lame, since it had
gone the most mediocre route. So, can it guess my age based on my track record?

I fucking love /About You/ by /The 1975/. I had actually found the song through a
[[https://youtu.be/iqGAW57EudQ?list=RDiqGAW57EudQ][fan AMV]] featuring the song with a cut-up and full of spoilers collection of
clips from /18×2 Beyond Youthful Days/. After I had discovered the song I'd tell
myself that I'm going to see the actual movie but I never got around to it and
don't know if I will, since I kind of know the whole story. Of course, texture
to me is more important, but I don't feel such a draw, especially with my
collection of physical Criterion and others discs that I haven't (yet) seen
growing at an alarming pace.

When it comes to albums and say I've listened to 13 of them... do they mean like
front-to-back sort of deal or simply ``touched an album''? I'm sure it's the
former, because there is no way 1,800+ songs reduce down to measely 13 albums,
otherwise, those would have been some massive releases. Okay, this one is
simple. I go weak for Chapell Roan's /After Midnight/. That one progression and
note that she hits on the

#+begin_quote
/'Cause After Midniighttt/ \
/I'm feeling kinda freaky,/ \
/maybe it's the club lights/ ---
#+end_quote

I'm not the biggest club go-er. In actuality, I think the biggest number of them
that are easily available to go to are kinda trashy. I can explain. They are TOO
loud. The music is TOO generic. And there is no charm or grace to drinking in
these places. But the vibe that /After Midnight/ the song has, which I imagine as
a more desolate, emptier club, but where the vibes are just right---then yes,
please sign me up.

And then after Chapell, we have all the ``indie'' and that modern soft music
style universe artists. Of course, we have Sabrina, Marias, love them jazz
anime, and Clairo.

And all of this new-found music taste is what they call the /Cloud Society/. I did
try to make it to Chapell's concert but all the tickets were completely sold
out. I had to go to an Oktoberfest event nearby the stadium and saw the line
extending more than a mile in bitter cold---I was never more happier to /not/ be
standing in some line for hours before the doors had even opened.

They also gave a breakdown on some anomalous days, where AI had done the heavy
lifting to write up a summary on what transpired on the day of. Pretty fun, I
guess? I can't tell what I was doing that day to warrant it, but seeing these
and trying to recollect the memories was pretty fun.

Okay, that's it! I've been procrastinating on this one, but I like to keep up
with the tradition and look back onto these recaps in the years to come. See ya
later and Merry Christmas!
