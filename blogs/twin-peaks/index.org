* Twin Peaks as a Cult Film ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

April 22nd, 2020

** Abstract
Twin Peaks was one of the biggest impacts TV industry has ever experienced thanks
to its rebellious nature against the traditional set values of mainstream media. In
the realm of "bad movies" and "trash aesthetics", this behavior is often
considered a cult film. This paper will research how David Lynch and Mark Frost
changed the film industry with their infamous TV series.

** Introduction
/Twin Peaks/ premiered on April 8, 1990 with 34.6 million 
[fn:: TV-aholic's TV Blog, Ratings Archive - April 2, 1990]
viewers on
its first day and it completely changed audience's perception of television
series as a whole. This research will show in what ways and how the legendary
/Twin Peaks/ can be referenced as a cult film.

"Cult audiences seek for films, and seek to enjoy films in ways that stand away
from regular or mainstream reception."
[fn:: The Cult Film Reader, Ernest Mathijs and Xavier Mendik, 2008, pp5-6]
Nowadays, we have a big
number of high standard TV shows: /Game of Thrones/, /Breaking Bad/, /The/
/Walking Dead/, and etc. However, looking back to 1990, there was no other film
like /Twin Peaks/. It stood out thanks to the heavy story-line that David Lynch
was introducing to the audience, to the beautifully composed landscapes and
shots, to the level of creative freedom that was unheard of in network
television.

Roughly 30 years ago, the "high-class" and "high-quality" film-making was
associated with movies and movies only. Audiences were used to classic film
genre masterpieces like: /The Shining/, /The Godfather/, /Space Odyssey: 2001/,
and etc. Television series were treated mostly as a comedy and means of casual
screening. Some of the popular shows that aired at that time were /Santa
Barbara/, /The Cosby Show/, /ALF/, and /Cheers/. /Twin Peaks/ was simultaneously
revolutionary and rebellious by introducing new standards to the field. This
work's behavior is called a cult movie. David Lynch's and Mark Frost's new
creation went against the established mainstream standards and introduced
something new and truly exciting. After the initial airing of /Twin Peaks/,
people saw what kind of emotional messages and new techniques can be implemented
to develop the area. This is one of the rarest cases where a cult film by going
against the mainstream values, has forced the mainstream itself to change and
take the cult film as an example. Because /Twin Peaks/' transition from Season 1
to Season 2 is so seamless and swift, both of the seasons will be discussed as
they were a single complete unit.

After all those years, /Twin Peaks/ has one of the biggest cult followings in
the history. COOP, a national /Twin Peaks/ fan organization, employed local
rallies and computer networking to try to keep that doomed series on the
air. With the recent release of the 3rd season - /The Return/, the
subculture got stronger and bigger with the revived attention to the series and
with the new cult fans joining in. Interestingly enough, with completely
changing the industry standards in the 90s, the new season was so bizarre,
unusual and fascinating that the season became a separate new generation of cult
film by itself. The last season introduced some outright strange and "absurd" 
plot development that still puzzles all the loyal fans.

To evaluate the "cult" value of /Twin Peaks/, I will analyze it from four major
elements: Anatomy, Consumption, and Cultural Status. At the conclusion of this
paper we should be able to prove our claim that "Twin Peaks" is a cult
film. Most of the term definitions are taken from a wonderful book by Ernest
Mathjis and Xavier Mendik --- "The Cult Film Reader". All the references to
the scenes and events from the series were taken from my personal screenings.
The following research contains spoilers for /Twin Peaks/, /The Return/.

** Anatomy
Anatomy researches the film itself from a technical point of view: content,
style, format, and generic modes. This is one of factors of cult films that
solely depend on the director and producer of the show.

*/Innovation./* From the very first moments of /Twin Peaks/' intro, the American
audience knew that this is not going to be a regular TV show they were all used
to. The opening credits sequence of /Twin Peaks/ is accompanied by Angelo
Badalamenti. The genius composer behind the /Twin Peaks/ soundtrack that "still
marks the summit of TV soundtracks". 
[fn:: Twin Peaks still marks the summit of TV soundtracks, The Guardian]
Even before the actual
start of the TV series, audience was already prepared to new experience only by
listening to the opening credits. The soundtrack might sound sentimental and
slow-developing in the beginning but it serves its purpose to set the mood for
the show. This approach that David Lynch made almost forces all of the members
of the audience to watch the opening credits in full. Where in contrast, most of
the 1980s and 1990s TV shows' (Knight Rider, 1982) opening credits could be
easily skipped because they just became an obstacle before an actual episode.

*/Badness./* It is almost a convention for cult movies to be "bad" due to
their poor acting, poor cinematic values, poor plot structure or everything
together. However, /Twin Peaks/ was not considered "bad" under any mainstream
criterion. On the contrary, it was revolutionary in terms of cinematography and
its acting crew. Every shot in the series was carefully composed and thought-out
by David Lynch himself. Many do not know the fact that the lamp flickering
technique that is used almost everywhere actually came from /Twin Peaks/. In the
first Season when the Leland Palmer goes to the morgue to identify the body of
his own daughter, Laura Palmer, the light above the morgue bed flickers. During
the set, the lamp actually broke but instead of replacing it, David Lynch told
the filming crew to leave it as it is. Accidentally or not, this created one of
the most used techniques in the movie industry. The way David Lynch embraced
random and probably bad things on the set is what made /Twin Peaks/ to some
extent "bad" and simultaneously original.
[fn:: Why WERE the Lights Always Flickering in â€˜Twin Peaksâ€™?, Indiewire]

*/Transgression./* A big factor of a cult film is its ability to blur the line
between what is believed to be "good" and "bad". David Lynch's first
feature-length film /Eraserhead/, 1977, is infamous for its inventiveness and
its ability to question the long-standing traditions about good and bad through
his employment of far-fetched technique that were outright "bad" in
traditional sense, however, they bring some authentic satisfaction to the
viewing experience that makes us to critically approach the mainstream
values. /Twin Peaks/ utilizes some of the techniques in the BOB sequences. BOB
is an inter-dimensional entity who performs horrific acts towards humanity to
"harvest" their pain and sorrow. David Lynch's mysticism is a key part of the
horror side of /Twin Peaks/. His approach to introduce BOB and other
supernatural parts were so bizarre and uncommon but they became widely accepted
and are still being debated to this day. It really does challenge the
conventional ways of thinking about good and bad values in cinematography.

*/Genre./* If you ask anyone to name a movie that combines Mystery, Drama, and
Horror, the unanimous answer will always be /Twin Peaks/. It is a common
technique of cult films to mix genres. This is one of practices that made cult
films more approachable (Alien, 1979) and likable. Some of the most popular
movies at the time were always a combination of different genres that made them
unique (Blade Runner, 1987). Twin Peaks is the first one to hit the classic
genres (Drama, Mystery, Horror) and to masterfully combine three of them into
one solid piece.

*/Loose ends./* Media produced in the cult field are infamous for making people
anxious about letting the endings stay loose. Meaning, without a logical
conclusion or a closure (Maniac, 1934). Some of the movies' endings are so
complex that if the director tried to make a reasonable conclusion, the audience
failed at comprehending it (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968). Twin Peaks Season Two
finale was not an exception and it left at the very confusing moment, where the
viewers were forced to guess if Dale Cooper at the end of the series is the real
agent from FBI or the doppelganger from the red room. /How's Annie?/ This
question has been answered 26 years later in the /Twin Peaks: The Return/ that
is considered to be the third season of the legendary show. Interestingly
enough, /The Return/ left more loose ends than the original run of the series.
Even in 26 years, David Lynch stayed true to his own "cult" values.

*/Nostalgia./* Nostalgia is the core feature of any cult film. It is the ability
of a cult film to trigger emotions from the idealized past. 
[fn:: Nostalgia: a Neuropsychiatric Understanding, Skidelsky, Robert, 2009]
Arguably, nostalgia is one of the strongest feelings /Twin Peaks/ successfully
triggers in its audience. David Lynch can be considered one of the classic film
directors from the past and he masterfully utilizes many things from the past in
/Twin Peaks/. Firstly, David Lynch skillfully connects the 90s clothing style
with the 50s and 60s clothing style of America. The main characters: Bobby
Riggs, Donna Hayward, and James Hurley, all wear the trending style of their
time, therefore symbolizing the youth of the series. 
[fn:: Style Guide: The Looks That Made Twin Peaks, Paste Magazine]
On the other
hand, employees at the famous Double R Diner, which was founded by Norma
Jennings in 1969, wear traditional clothes from the 1960s, invoking nostalgic
feelings in the audience members. It has a very strong effect, because that
period of time from 1951 until 1970, is considered to be the Golden Age of
America. 
[fn:: Keynes: The Return of the Master, Skidelsky, Robert, 2009]
People enjoy remembering the old good days,
subsequently, they enjoy watching /Twin Peaks/ that helps them to remember
them. Surprisingly, /The Return/ does not try to evoke nostalgic feelings
towards 1960s, on the contrary, it is making references to the interval of time
when the original run of /Twin Peaks/ was aired.

*/Gore./* Utilizing gore in films is a sure way to be granted a cult film
status. However, first two seasons of /Twin Peaks/ did not show any explicit
elements of gore. There were moments of domestic violence, where Leo Johnson was
beat his wife, Shelley Johnson, with a sock stuffed with a bar of soap (Season
1, Episode 1). This action was not shown, we see only how Leo stuffs the sock,
then the screen goes black accompanied by Shelley's scream, finally we only see
the consequences of Shelley having a bruise in later scenes. Besides that, the
original episodes did not promote gore. Maybe this is one of the reasons why
/Twin Peaks/ is considered a family show. On the other hand, /The Return/
embraces explicit gore and horror. In no way, the third season is
family-friendly. In the very first episode, the series become pure horror and
the audience is left frightened on what happens next. Figure
\ref{fig:experiment} shows the supernatural entity that is connected to the
spirit of BOB. We see the "Experiment" materialize in the glass box in New
York, violently killing the couple on the couch by hacking them to death. Figure 
\ref{fig:tree} shows "The arm", who transformed from a little man in a red suit
to an electric tree that whispers in backward riddles. Finally, Figure
\ref{fig:darya} shows a brutal execution that was carried out by Dale Cooper's
doppelganger. The figures below show how over the years, David Lynch embraced
gore, violence, and mysticism into his work.

** The consumption of Twin Peaks

The way cult films are received by an audience differs drastically from the way
mainstream films are received. Cult films do not concentrate on getting box
office figures or mass audiences, although there are some exceptions (Herschell
Gordon Lewis). In this current scope, /Twin Peaks/ is a really interesting case
to investigate. The show is one of the most beloved and critically acclaimed TV
series ever made. Right before the initial air of the "Pilot" episode, Media
Analyst Paul Schulman said, "I don't think it has a chance of succeeding. It is
not commercial, it is radically different from what we as viewers are accustomed
to seeing, there's no one in the show to root for."
[fn:: High Hopes for Twin Peaks, Roush, Matt, 1990, USA Today]
It was reasonable
to think this way because both /The Colbys/ spin-off and /Dynasty/ failed at the
same time slot that /Twin Peaks/ had, Thursday nights. From its release,
everyone in the time knew what /Twin Peaks/ was. 34.6 rating on the first day
made it ABC's most successful show of the 1990s. David Lynch's and
Mark Frost's show was ranked among the Top 25 Cult Shows and Top 50 Television
Programs of All Time by /TV Guide/ 
[fn:: Twin Peaks, AMERICAN TELEVISION SHOW, EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]
and was nominated as
one of the 100 Best TV shows in history.
[fn:: All-TIME 100 TV Shows, TIME]
Actually, /Twin
Peaks/ is in every top TV shows listings, which indicates what a massive success
it was. If it a TV show got all this attention from the mainstream media, is it
still "cult"? Yes, it is. /Twin Peaks/ has one of the biggest cult followings
of any TV show. No other fan base of a TV show lasted for more than 25 years and
still trying to unravel mysteries and secrets that directors put into the
series.

*/Active celebration, community, liveness, and commitment./* The followers of
/Twin Peaks/ fan base and cult is massive to say the least. We have COOP, a
national /Twin Peaks/ fan organization With the new era of the
Internet, loyal fans from all around the world came together and formed
communities like: Twin Peaks Wikia, biggest website that is solely dedicated to
the series. It has transcripts for all episodes, separate web pages for
characters, events, places, and theories about the show. The website is purely
community-driven, meaning that fans gather together and produce new material for
the show just because of their devotion to it. 
[fn:: Twin Peaks Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia]
/Twin Peaks/ also has
a separate page on Reddit, most influential discussion board service. With over
76 thousand 
[fn:: r/twinpeaks, Reddit]
readers, the community makes hundreds pages long
discussions about new episodes, new theories, and new revelations. This
community does not seem to wish stopping. Every day, new questions are being
asked and more answers are needed.

** The cultural status of Twin Peaks
Sometimes, cults films can be regarded as "strange" and even "weird" due to
their use of unusual and often inappropriate techniques. Casual or uneducated
audience may jsut disregard it as a flick or a trick used by directors, however,
some cases and /Twin Peaks/ especially, carry a very important task of
critically analyzing and criticizing current cultural status, society structure,
or topics that people usually do not openly discuss.

*/Strangeness and Allegory./* One of the factors may be the location of /Twin
Peaks/ as a city. Filmed in a beautiful state of Washington near a waterfall
surrounded by famous douglas firs. Not every film features such relaxing yet
mysterious locations as David Lynch's and Mark Frost's creation does. This is
one of the important but subtle signs of something odd and out of place. BOB,
The Arm, Little Man, Red Room, and etc. are the truly strange parts of the show
that granted its cult status.

*/Cultural sensitives and politics./* The status of a film as a cultural
representation is related to its cult reputation. The reputation
of a cult film increases as its cult fandom grows, its cult status is becoming
more culturally acceptable, and the meanings are becoming more and more
ambigiuos. Truly, the creators of /Twin Peaks/, David Lynch and Mark Frost
introduced to the world a TV show about a dead high school beauty queen wrapped
in a plastic on the beach, special FBI Agent investigating the case while
drinking the finest coffee with the best cherry pie you could buy in a small
town in the state of Washington that is visited by out-of-the-world demonic
creatures whose sole purpose is to corrupt the residents of our fine small
town. To the surprise of all audiences members and even the cast, /Twin Peaks/
not only became a part of history, it changed and it completely and
permanently.
