oop is cool \
its all about what tools best fit the job \

#+begin_export html

#+end_export

*sandy* \
oop has a need in this world \
it's the necessary evil \

#+begin_export html
<img class="image avatar" src="/shared/avatars/jame.jpg">
#+end_export

*jame* \
kinda like abstract algebra \
many problems are naturally object oriented \

#+begin_export html
<img class="image avatar" src="/shared/avatars/sandy.jpg">
#+end_export

*sandy* \
unfortunately\
I think there is a better paradigm\
we just haven't found it yet\

#+begin_export html
<img class="image avatar" src="/shared/avatars/jame.jpg">
#+end_export
*jame* \
hmmm maybe\
i would like to find it\
"the universal paradigm" wouldnt that be something...\

#+begin_export html
<img class="image avatar" src="/shared/avatars/sandy.jpg">
#+end_export

*sandy* \
yeah...\

#+begin_export html

People who say oop are bad are cringe\
Its overused, not bad\

We more mean that itâ€™s bad in how itâ€™s used\

OOP has a very strong core, but more recent developments and over-abstractions
made it a big mess

So I do like OOP, things like Spring and insane factories that donâ€™t even serve
the purpose of scalability and modularity are too overused

JVM is a state-of-the-art machine though. However, times are much different from
1970s. Modern compilers can cross-compile to any architecture and ship them
there

So by building native binaries and sending them to your fleet is much better
than running JVM, which is very expensive

Saying Java is good because it runs on all machines with JVM is like saying that
anal is good because all sexes have a pooping hole
