* OOP

*jame* \
oop is cool\
its all about what tools best fit the job\

*sandy* \
oop has a need in this world\
it's the necessary evil\

*jame* \
kinda like abstract algebra\
many problems are naturally object oriented\

*sandy* \
unfortunately\
I think there is a better paradigm\
we just haven't found it yet\
