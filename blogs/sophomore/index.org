* The strange sophomore year ðŸ¥´

176; 12022 H.E.

** Fall 2019

This was by far the darkest semester I have had up until then. I was called
/suicidal/ and /crazy/ for taking a semester of 6 courses (18 credit hours), where
each course was an Honors class. Recall that Honors classes can be twice as hard
as their regular versions.
