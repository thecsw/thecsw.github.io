<p>I love watching anime. It hasn&#8217;t always been like this. I think the
first time I got introduced to it was when I was around six or seven. I
was living in Bulgaria at that time, I don&#8217;t think we even had Cartoon
Network. A small TV somewhere on our backyard porch would run
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok√©mon:_Indigo_League">Pok√©mon: Indigo
League</a> on some unnamed channel, which I think is as far as you can go
in terms of animated pokemon. I was waiting patiently for every "new"
episode after coming back home from school. Then there was a long break.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I briefly came back to watching anime when my best friend in high school
recommended I watch <em>Steins;Gate</em>. I liked the genre a lot. It was of
course the time when I was super young and many concepts might have
flown right past me. Right after, my second serious watch was <em>Mirai
Nikki</em>. You are probably more familiar with it through this picture of a
girl seductively looking at you.</p>

<div class="title">Yuno Gasai&#8217;s yandere expression</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a 15-year-old high school boy, I loved the show. The things that
happened in the show and scenes presented, I&#8217;ve never seen anything like
it in movies or books. It was brash, suggestive, violent, and
uncompromising. My friend from before scolded me a little bit, saying
it&#8217;s a low-tier show that is just about a yandere girl running around
and killing everyone. Finally, I finished that small high school era of
anime with <em>Kill la Kill</em>. I was just <strong>obsessed</strong> with it, especially
with Ry≈´ko Matoi. I bored my other friend so much that she drew me Ry≈´ko
dressed in her transformed Kamui. Thank you, Meruel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we&#8217;re here. Almost five years later, I re-sparked my love for the
genre once again and oh boy, it came in blazing <strong>big time</strong>. Right around
the last days of 2020, I started watching <em>Darling in the Franxx</em>. Flew
back home and finished it thereby staying up till 3 am and grinding the
episodes. It was something about the timing when the show came into my
life and my state. It clicked so perfectly, I got hooked like an addict.
Fell in love with Zero Two ‚ù§Ô∏è. Since then, watched the hits of Gainax,
all of the Trigger, and more. Now we are done with this exhaustive
history. Let&#8217;s talk about anime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is so much that anime can do, which almost every single other
genre is practically incapable of doing. A simple example would be the
fight scenes and their dynamics. Think of books as media. The heat and
action of it are almost entirely dependent on the author&#8217;s way of words
and your imagination. Live-action films with real actors and no matter
what amount of CGI you throw at it can never reach the heat an anime
can, simply because they are still bound by how real-life looks. You
can&#8217;t enlarge someone 10x and make it as intimidating as Ira Gamag≈çri
looking down on students. It would just
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">look goofy and unnatural</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing comparing the genres, you might ask, but what about cartoons?
Isn&#8217;t anime just a cartoon genre? Well, in a very very trivial sense,
yes. However, "cartoons" usually refer to the Western animation style,
while "anime" refers to hand-drawn and computer animation originating
from Japan. Anime excels because it is cinematically shot as if by a
camera, including panning, zooming, and more complex angle shots, which
are hard in practice. Western cartoons are very much standardized in
animation style, plot building, and their impact. They feel bland. Anime
can overcome that by tackling topics and themes no regular cartoon would
even come close to, while also employing a large array of over-the-top
action and scenes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, okay, so what&#8217;s the actual appeal of anime to me? That is it. The
absolute freedom in plots and characters. Want to see a half-naked girl
fighting clothes with half a scissors? <em>Kill la Kill</em>. Want to see
robots as big as the Observable Universe smash each other? <em>Tengen Toppa
Gurren Lagann</em>. Is a man able to kill anyone with a single punch, even
cosmos overlords? <em>One Punch Man</em>. Conductors using their batons to
fight aliens with the power of Classical Music? <em>Takt</em> <em>Op. Destiny</em>.
This list is pretty tame, just the first ones that came to my mind. In
many ways, it&#8217;s so unrealistic and many times so much far and beyond our
reality that it can make some viewers dizzy or brush off the entire
genre as too phantasmagorical. I want to make a case that we need this
too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me give a little background into my experience with fine arts and
media. I major in Classic Literature. The number of greatest and most
"realist" works I&#8217;ve read and the amount of pages and analysis I wrote
on them is something I&#8217;m still recovering from. It doesn&#8217;t get more real
than Russian Literature from the 17-18th centuries, with the greats like
Gogol, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. I loved the books so much that I decided
to major in them. I adore realism and works that just crush your heart
and shatter your soul. There is some painful blood-ridden personal and
emotional growth in there. However, no matter how much I love it, it
would be impossible and dangerous to the psyche to constantly immerse
yourself in the greatest and hardest books ever written.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this little background, I want to assure you that my point of view
and love for Japanese animation is not driven just because I know
nothing else or am stuck in it, as many people went to point that out. I
am intimately acquainted with all different genres, this leads me to
believe that what we need is the balance between them. We need the
over-the-top-crazy-impossible-phantasmagorical world that anime brings
and Russian-style-sad-real-dead-on realism. Only with understanding and
appreciating both ends of the spectrum, can we refine our tastes and
build more critical points of view on what we consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anime gives a better breathing room, allowing you to abstract yourself
from all the small swamp-like details and worries of life, project them
onto a world, where giant robots fight aliens in dashingly choreographed
ways. To the fullest sense, it inspires me. I drive out the energy and
stimulation from those shows to find a new perspective to many
situations in life and freshen up a bit, to dream. Anime is on the crazy
side of the spectrum, hard literature is on the opposite side of
crushing realism, we don&#8217;t need anything in between. Our day-to-day
lives and routine already suffice for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anime music is also <strong>incredible</strong>. Here is my playlist with the ones I
like a lot</p>
