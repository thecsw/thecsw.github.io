* I love watching anime üéª

12; 12022 H.E.

I love watching anime. It hasn't always been like this. I think the first time I
got introduced to it was when I was around six or seven. I was living in
Bulgaria at that time, I don't think we even had Cartoon Network. A small TV
somewhere on our backyard porch would run [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok√©mon:_Indigo_League][Pok√©mon: Indigo League]] on some unnamed
channel, which I think is as far as you can go in terms of animated pokemon. I
was waiting patiently for every "new" episode after coming back home from
school. Then there was a long break.  

I briefly came back to watching anime when my best friend in high school
recommended I watch /Steins;Gate/. I liked the genre a lot. It was of course the
time when I was super young and many concepts might have flown right past
me. Right after, my second serious watch was /Mirai Nikki/. You are probably more
familiar with it through this picture of a girl seductively looking at you.

As a 15-year-old high school boy, I loved the show. The things that happened in
the show and scenes presented, I've never seen anything like it in movies or
books. It was brash, suggestive, violent, and uncompromising. My friend from
before scolded me a little bit, saying it's a low-tier show that is just about a
yandere girl running around and killing everyone. Finally, I finished that small
high school era of anime with /Kill la Kill/. I was just *obsessed* with it,
especially with Ry≈´ko Matoi. I bored my other friend so much that she drew me
Ry≈´ko dressed in her transformed Kamui. Thank you, Meruel.  

Now we're here. Almost five years later, I re-sparked my love for the genre once
again and oh boy, it came in blazing *big time*. Right around the last days of
2020, I started watching /Darling in the Franxx/. Flew back home and finished it
thereby staying up till 3 am and grinding the episodes. It was something about
the timing when the show came into my life and my state. It clicked so
perfectly, I got hooked like an addict. Fell in love with Zero Two ‚ù§Ô∏è. Since
then, watched the hits of Gainax, all of the Trigger, and more. Now we are done
with this exhaustive history. Let's talk about anime.  

There is so much that anime can do, which almost every single other genre is
practically incapable of doing. A simple example would be the fight scenes and
their dynamics. Think of books as media. The heat and action of it are almost
entirely dependent on the author's way of words and your
imagination. Live-action films with real actors and no matter what amount of CGI
you throw at it can never reach the heat an anime can, simply because they are
still bound by how real-life looks. You can't enlarge someone 10x and make it as
intimidating as Ira Gamag≈çri looking down on students. It would just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley][look goofy
and unnatural]].

Continuing comparing the genres, you might ask, but what about cartoons? Isn't
anime just a cartoon genre? Well, in a very very trivial sense, yes. However,
"cartoons" usually refer to the Western animation style, while "anime" refers to
hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. Anime excels because
it is cinematically shot as if by a camera, including panning, zooming, and more
complex angle shots, which are hard in practice. Western cartoons are very much
standardized in animation style, plot building, and their impact. They feel
bland. Anime can overcome that by tackling topics and themes no regular cartoon
would even come close to, while also employing a large array of over-the-top
action and scenes.  

Okay, okay, so what's the actual appeal of anime to me? That is it. The absolute
freedom in plots and characters. Want to see a half-naked girl fighting clothes
with half a scissors? /Kill la Kill/. Want to see robots as big as the Observable
Universe smash each other? /Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann/. Is a man able to kill
anyone with a single punch, even cosmos overlords? /One Punch Man/. Conductors
using their batons to fight aliens with the power of Classical Music? /Takt/
/Op. Destiny/. This list is pretty tame, just the first ones that came to my
mind. In many ways, it's so unrealistic and many times so much far and beyond
our reality that it can make some viewers dizzy or brush off the entire genre as
too phantasmagorical. I want to make a case that we need this too.  

Let me give a little background into my experience with fine arts and media. I
major in Classic Literature. The number of greatest and most "realist" works
I've read and the amount of pages and analysis I wrote on them is something I'm
still recovering from. It doesn't get more real than Russian Literature from the
17-18th centuries, with the greats like Gogol, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. I loved
the books so much that I decided to major in them. I adore realism and works
that just crush your heart and shatter your soul. There is some painful
blood-ridden personal and emotional growth in there. However, no matter how much
I love it, it would be impossible and dangerous to the psyche to constantly
immerse yourself in the greatest and hardest books ever written.  

With this little background, I want to assure you that my point of view and love
for Japanese animation is not driven just because I know nothing else or am
stuck in it, as many people went to point that out. I am intimately acquainted
with all different genres, this leads me to believe that what we need is the
balance between them. We need the over-the-top-crazy-impossible-phantasmagorical
world that anime brings and Russian-style-sad-real-dead-on realism. Only with
understanding and appreciating both ends of the spectrum, can we refine our
tastes and build more critical points of view on what we consume.   

Anime gives a better breathing room, allowing you to abstract yourself from all
the small swamp-like details and worries of life, project them onto a world,
where giant robots fight aliens in dashingly choreographed ways. To the fullest
sense, it inspires me. I drive out the energy and stimulation from those shows
to find a new perspective to many situations in life and freshen up a bit, to
dream. Anime is on the crazy side of the spectrum, hard literature is on the
opposite side of crushing realism, we don't need anything in between. Our
day-to-day lives and routine already suffice for that.  

Anime music is also *incredible*. Here is my playlist with the ones I like a lot
