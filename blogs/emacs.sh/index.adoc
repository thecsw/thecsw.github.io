After years of carefully cultivating and taking care of my `.emacs.d`
config files, I thought it may be time to try and share it, maybe
someone will like it

I host my `.emacs.d` on https://github.com/thecsw/.emacs.d[github],
however, it depends on some LSP quirks and go tools that I decided
writing a quick shell script to do the work. You can visit the config's
webpage https://sandyuraz.com/.emacs.d[here].

All you have to run is the curl command below in your home directory
(`_`)

NOTE: existing installation will move to .bak append

[source,bash]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/master/sh/emacs.sh | sh
----

It will clone `.emacs.d`, symlink `.emacs`, and optionally install
golang X tools (considering you have Go installed)

emacs-lsp now)
