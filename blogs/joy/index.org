We have these widespread series at work, where speakers are invited to present
on any topic they find interesting---does not have to be related to anything one
is working on nor does it even have to be about tech. Some talk about their
gardens, others about financial planning, etc. And what a surprise, I got an
invitation to become a speaker at the end of one of the major cycles.

All of the preparation and work for this one had been done in my own free time,
on my personal laptop, without any reliance on anything from work, as this is a
topic that had captivated me for some time and hadn't really let go ever
since---how do we stay conscious in the fast-moving and unforgiving environment
that wants to take us for a ride by having us surrender any sense of control of
what we use and what we rely on in our day to day lives?

I cannot share the talk itself as that would be locked behind the gates that
shall never be opened, but please enjoy the walking deck below that by reading
through will give the first impression of what I am passionate about today. If
the embed below doesn't work, you can open [[Crafting Joy in the Digital Age.pdf][the deck through this link]].

It feels as if very few to none question or discuss the current state of
computing and the entire situation is only exacerbated by the break-neck speed
at which the whole AI world moves at. If we keep moving in a direction that we
never question nor challenge the foundation it stands on, then we have no hope
of leading conscious lives with full understanding of ourselves and why do we do
what we do every day.

The feedback from a talk like this was expectedly controversial, where some saw
this as an impossible paradigm and a waste of time with verbatim ``why would I
waste my time on documentation'' with ``just use strongly typed languages then
it's immune to bad code review and the code self-documents'' that rounds up into
``I will never have time for documentation because I just need to write code to
ship the next deliverable don't waste my time'' sort of feedback.

Which is real unfortunate, since I don't even want anyone to sit down and change
the entire course of their lives or how they do regular programming, but at the
very least, spark a discussion, albeit an internal one, then dismissing all this
voodoo ``Literate Programming` thing Sandy mentioned and keeping to the same way
is totally valid, at least now, doing it so consciously.

Some though had a welcoming look in their eyes and shared with me that they felt
the same way, as if the craft is being lost and the certain magical joy of what
makes programming fun in the first place had been eradicating away chip by
chip. Feeling more powerless with the over-abstraction of the world, we must
think more, build more, write more, and live with our eyes open.
