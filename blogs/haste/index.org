* Haste slowly, my friend ðŸ§¸

/I need to do this, I can't miss that, and more/ is what we tell ourselves every
day, trying to accomplish tasks and fill our ``productivity meters` throughout
the day. We hurry so much onto doing as many things as possible that no time is
being left out to enjoy doing the things we... enjoy doing. You of course can
like the things you do throughout the day, however, that time you spend just
with yourself is as equally important. I ask myself, is this modern busyness
needed or is its necessity something that we made ourselves believe in?
