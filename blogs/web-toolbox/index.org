* Essential toolbox for the web 🧰

** Abstract
   Internet is a great place for content and cat videos, but also really bad
   stuff, like traumatizing advertisements, endless user data collection, and
   straight-up spying. This page is a soft introduction into some tools,
   services, browser extensions you can use to get back control of your online
   presence.

   /Call it an internet usage etiquette./ -- Matthew, my friend

** Adblockers
   Allowing people use the Internet without an adblocker is a violation of
   Geneva Conventions. What an adblocker does is block ads and those noisy
   webpage elements that jump at you or show unholy pictures. More on that
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising][here]].

   There is an adblocker that's called [[https://getadblock.com/][AdBlock]], however, after years of using
   it, I now prefer [[https://ublock.org/][uBlock]]. It just seems to be faster and simpler to use. The
   extensions automatically block all known advertising sources. You can also
   block specific elements manually.

** Trackers
   [[https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetsafety/understanding-browser-tracking/1/][Browser tracking]] is one of those evil things that came into web couple of
   years ago. Essentially, every time you visit a website, it saves a small
   piece of data in your browser (cookie), where later it will allow any other
   website to track your browsing history and activity. Cookies are essential
   for services, as it helps you to stay logged in and make your browsing
   experience more comfortable. As everything, it gets misused pretty often.

   [[https://privacybadger.org/][Privacy Badger]] automatically learns to block invisible trackers. Some random
   websites out of nowhere should not be able to know what pages you looked at
   and where you're heading off next.

** Browser scripts
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript][JavaScript]] is one of the saddest technological developments that we
   wholeheartedly embraced. JS is code that runs in your browser. Almost all of
   the  buttons you clicked, forms filled, animations played, and even pages
   loaded is JavaScript. It's so critical for everything that it gets abused
   more than anything else. Any website can run arbitrary code in your browser,
   which can create any number of questionable actions executed on your behalf.

   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint][Device fingerprint]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercookie][unstoppable tracking]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_sniffing][browser sniffing]], and etc. exist
   because any random code can run on your machine without you even knowing it.

   [[https://noscript.net/][NoScript]] pre-emptively blocks scripts running in your browser. You will get a
   manual but full control of all code sources, where you will be able to allow
   or block specific resources. It is a bit inconvenient the first time you use
   it, as websites tend to over-rely on JS just for loading. Couple of days in,
   I allowed some specific JS sources and it never bothered me again.

** IP Tracking
   By the definition of how we do networking, every web resource is able to see
   the origin's (user's) IP address, thus the unique web identifier of the
   Internet. It takes no effort to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_traceback][trace IP back]] to ISPs, precise locations, and
   even individuals. The most popular way of "hiding" your IP address is using
   VPN services.

   This is how naked connections looks like, it may not even be secured and
   there might be an eavesdropper in the middle!

   VPN is basically accessing the internet goods through a secure middle-man
   that ideally keeps your identity secret and takes the main hit of being
   exposed to everything out there

                          ┌─────┴────────┐

   You were probably bombarded by millions of different VPN ads, like *NordVPN*,
   *ProtonVPN*, *BearVPN*? There are some you should NOT use. Like [[https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/ufo-vpn-data-exposure/][UFO VPN]],
   they made a promise of not storing the original plain data and keep no logs
   (user activity traces). They did.

   I personally would recommend [[https://mullvad.net/en/][Mullvad VPN]]. It is the fastest VPN out there
   that deploys latest VPN standards (Wireguard) and most
   privacy-respectful. It's priced at ridiculously fair $5/mo. No personal
   data. Creating a mullvad "account" (just a collection of numbers) takes no
   time. You can actually pay for mullvad access with cash. Anonymously mail
   cash with your account number and it's loaded.
