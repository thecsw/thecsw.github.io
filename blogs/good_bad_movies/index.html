<p>My Spring break got extended, all classes are going to transcend into
the cloud for the foreseeable future, and I have a lot of time to spare
on my hands. I love watching movies, it is actually my favorite medium
of entertainment. Looking at the screen and seeing someone else&#8217;s
imagination form the scenes, charaters, and the plot. I wish to consider
myself having a film version of melomania. However, every time I talk to
my mother about movies, I just shock her into silence. I&#8217;m probably
nowhere near her on the movie tastes scale and she would tell me I&#8217;m
watching the wrong kind of movies. I thought for a quick while, what
does it mean to watch good and bad movies?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just for the sake of credit, I&#8217;m not a film major, nor do I possess an
extensive academia-level of expertise in films analysis. I took a film
class my college freshman year, FMS 380, which was titled <strong>Shocks!
Thrills!: Trash Cinema</strong>. Easily, one of my favorite classes I have ever
taken. We talked trash. By that I mean the absolute trash, someone might
even say garbage. The lowest, filthiest, and probably unknown movies
ranging in themes from government enforced sexual hygiene to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space">vampires invading
other planets</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado">sharks falling
from the sky.</a> Watching bad stuff kinda shapes the way you look and
perceive everything else. I am not implying that you have to watch a bad
movie with every good movie or anything that is even close to that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Watching and just knowing what bad movies are helped me to start
recognizing and valuing some of the small stuff that I may have taken
for granted before. By only watching the best of the best, the bar for
films was so high for me that I became some kind of a snob, trying to
nitpick every smallest flaw in them. We probably have some people in our
lives that when we go to movies with them, they would start pointing out
some smallest deviations from what their imaginative masterpiece version
of what they just saw. It is absolutely fine for them to express their
emotions, it just got me thinking that if I follow their logic, then I
can trash every movie and just shift my perception of them completely.
It is a dangerous game of downplaying. It is equivalent of only eating
caviar and then complaining about how cheap bread is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Diversifying the movies you watch can help to set your frame of
reference straight and recognize the whole spectrum of distinct movies.
I believe this can be applied to anything. But I also see some people
that try to surrender themselves to pure trash and garbash, talking bad
about mainstream media. I don&#8217;t think this is a good idea. It&#8217;s never
too good for being a fanatic of anything. You lose that connection with
other people by becoming too "niche" and "elite". People like that may
feel like a stranger to the society (guess why) and then those people
can (or will) get angry with everyone else around them, which never
leads to a anything good. Just enjoy watching what you enjoy watching.
Recognize the amount of work it takes to make something like that and
just have a good time. Don&#8217;t be a fanatic.</p>
