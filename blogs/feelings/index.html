I can’t seem to feel when I want to feel so desperately. When I must feel, why do I not have that sensation? There is something to be said of not being overly emotional or letting the fleeting sensations of the moment control the mind, but there is an equally strong argument to be made in favor of following those gusts of inspiration, as they often lead to places and times that are locked to anyone with a mind that is too literal and rational. Where does the carelessness stop and indifference start?
</p>

I remember how watching movies made me feel as if I were involved in the scene unfolding right in front of my eyes. The heroes of the story arguing and fighting of whatever it might be—I’m there, in the corner of the room, in the front seat of the bus, or standing across the corner of the street, seeing it unfolding. Feeling what the air smells like. Feeling what the sensation of the moment is down to the humidity level. And now, instead of feeling, it’s knowing, but it’s a lonely world out here, because instead of experiencing it so, I can only imagine what it must <em>feel</em> like to live through it, rather than giving myself to it almost unconsciously.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Maybe it is the busy life, but what I watch now feels more like content rather than art. The memories of what I watch are stronger than the moment itself. Watching <em>Happy Together</em> by Wong Kar-Wai right now, I haven’t felt anything. Not to say that I’m forcing myself to feel things, as that is a dead-end for real. What happened? I used to watch the likes of <em>Lost in Translation</em> or <em>The Big Lebowski</em> and know exactly what those environments were like without ever physically being present there. What is the balance? How do we stay feeling and conscious beings, but also not become slaves to it? How do I do it?
</p>

Listening to <em>Something About Us</em> during my first big heartbreak, it was devastating yet healing. I could say there was an argument of fetishizing one’s depression or feeling sorry for oneself and one—me, specifically—should only do so for a very limited time, otherwise it has a nasty habit of growing uncontrollably into something much more mediocre. As much as I would like to avoid that, I fear of becoming something too rational, too analytical, too unfeeling. Do I feel so much from day to day life that I no longer have the capacity to extend it to the arts I used to devote so much of  myself to?
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I also know that I cannot and must not force myself to feel, as that defeats the purpose of the genuine reaction. But, somehow we must also train and discipline ourselves to be present in the moment, but thoughts creep in that may not be there and giving them too much attention—even subconsciously—irritates us and makes me want it to go away, which only accents the attention on it ever so more. The mind is not something physical that we can simply touch and affect directly by grabbing everything that mustn’t be there and plugging it off.

Last time I recall feeling and getting transported to another life, another Universe was reading through <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>. My day to day then as a college student about to graduate was trying. In the morning, I would do my classes’ homework assignment and some async lectures. From then until evening-ish, I was working as a research fellow at a national lab, so no rest of the wicked there. From the early hours of the evening after work, with a little sustenance that went a long way back then, I would grab my ten pound <em>BK</em> and read carefully through each line until I exhaust myself to the point of passing out on the couch where all of my reading and weeping would happen.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Famously, I always say that my reading experience had peaked with <em>BK</em>, which I still believe to be the case. I say that in the best possible sense, since it does not take away the enjoyment—at least, not fully—from whatever I’m reading, but I know that seldom anything could reach the heights <em>Dostoevsky</em> conquered with his novel. It is such that I refuse to believe a mere mortal man can produce anything of this substance, it’s too much. It must be the Universe taking a snapshot of what had actually transpired at that time and materializing paper with all the ink on it. All of this because I refuse to believe a human mind can internalize and articulate emotions of such depth in such a way.
</p>

I don’t know. Living a life too rational is to devoid yourself of the pleasures of what makes us... us, but take it too much in the other way, and you have the infantile and naivete that gets warned about everywhere. What is the practical application of romance to the modern life? If <em>Dostoevsky</em> talked of “active love”, where is the “active feeling” or “active romance” as in the <em>BK</em>-style definition of what it means to feel freely and subconsciously, but also staying rational around them? I should go and read more and watch more and try to stay present more. I think I am present. I think I am. I think I am. I’m here. Hello. <b style="color:var(--color-tomb)">◼︎</b>
