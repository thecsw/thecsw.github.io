* My tools and my colors 🍬

240; 12022 H.E.

I like having my computers and tools tailor-made to suit my tastes and wants. It
makes me feel at home. When I see my favorite collection of colors, contrasts,
and schemas, it feels right. It might not be the best approach for your
productivity, as you would spend the first couple of hours to a couple of days
fine-tuning whatever you have in front of you to your liking. Yet, I believe
there is value in bending anything and everything to feel at home.

In the past, I made a [[https://github.com/thecsw/config-files][config files]] repository, where I stored all my cool Linux
dotfiles, [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/using_mutt/][mutt stuff]], custom shell scripts for [[http://acme.cat-v.org][acme]], and more... This is all in
the past now. I was still in high school. Then, I made a [[https://github.com/thecsw/dotfiles][new repository]], which I
conveniently named /dotfiles/ to replace /config-files/. *What a novel idea!* However,
I quickly fall out of the habit of manually updating the configs or using
special programs that take a list of target files and hard symlink before
pushing updates. Why not write them out on a page on my website with pictures
and all the cool stuff?

** Terminal 

*THiS iS ExcItINg*. First of all, I have to start with my colors and preferences
for the terminal. I like darker backgrounds and brighter foregrounds. But not
too bright. White on black is one sure way to strain your eyes with a one-way
ticket. All the /cool hackers/ like the ``green-on-black,'' which I think looks
incredibly tacky and hardly legible. Unless you convince yourself
otherwise. Many developers I was never too fond of always used this matrix color
scheme.

I'm sorry, it doesn't make you look cool or feel like it. I know it because I
have also had it as my terminal for years. It is something you need to grow out
of. I like the /classy/ ``orange-on-black'' balance, which gives off nice [[https://youtu.be/Y6ljFaKRTrI][Portal -
/Still Alive/]] vibes. Here are my preferred colors: =#ffd000= for foreground,
=#000000= for background, =#a466a5= for selection, and =#f4f4f4= for selected text. As
a sheltered macOS user, I use [[https://iterm2.com][iTerm2]]. In Todd Howard's fashion, ``It just
works.''

[[terminal.webp][I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.]] 

Portal is a great game.  

** Font 

Oh, and yeah. Forgot about the fonts. I always use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_(typeface)][Monaco]] for Sans-serif
monospace fonts when coding and such. Unfortunately, Apple didn't think of
including the bold variant with their default systems, so there is [[https://github.com/vjpr/monaco-bold][this patch]],
which will get you the Monaco font with a bold-variant.

** Emacs 

Emacs is next. Oh, emacs. How long have we been together? I think it is around
the fifth or sixth year now. The longest relationship I have had with any
software. Emacs's been there through thick and thin. In my lonely nights as a
college student, stressful afternoons at work, and lovely mornings of focus. We
have shared a sacred bond -- a [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/emacs.sh/][mutual config file]] that we have already been
maintaining for many years. Here is to our friendship, camaraderie, and fruitful
partnership.

With a preface like that, the way emacs feels and looks is meaningful to
me. Very much so. Spending hours looking at a screen should bring you joy and
the kind that lasts for years. For the looks, I primarily depend on the
*fantastic* Andre Richter's [[https://github.com/andre-richter/emacs-lush-theme][emacs-lush-theme]], which in turn is inspired by [[http://jdhuntington.com/paste/color-theme-blackboard.el.html][JD
Huntington's blackboard theme]]. I have some [[https://sandyuraz.com/.emacs.d/#org1019aa6][custom faces]] added in for LSP
integrations and such. Of course, I cannot miss the fantastic work done by
[[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], who brings the elegance of modern UIs to emacs. I forked [[https://sandyuraz.com/.emacs.d/#orgd5b797e][my version]]
of it a long time ago, which I've been happily using for years.

** IntelliJ IDEA 

IntelliJ is one of those things that I refuse to believe exist because it makes
me concerned whether they are tapping directly into my brain when I'm writing
some of that sweet Java. Phenomenal IDE with state-of-the-art [[https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/05/debugger-basics-in-intellij-idea/][debugger]], freaky
[[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html][code completion]], and much more. I only found one fatal flaw with the software --
it didn't have a theme I liked. They do have a plugin, which [[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10804-the-doki-theme][puts an anime girl]]
in the bottom right of the screen with accompanying color schemes. It's /kinda/
cool.

But that is not what I'm looking for. Creating themes for IntelliJ is [[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/themes.html#completing-the-default-ui-theme-description-file][too
hard]]. What I did instead is I found a theme I liked on its principles -- /Lotus
Dark/ from [[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14369-lotus-theme][Lotus Theme]]. Later, I adapted =lush-theme= from emacs using color
schemes and called it [[https://github.com/thecsw/najimi-jetbrains][najimi-jetbrains]]. Now, I feel safe once again.

[[intelliji.webp][I live for Najimi ❤️‍🔥]] 

The color scheme is currently meant for Java codebases. I might add other
languages if I feel like it one morning.

** Other 

I love pink, purple, and all the adjacent colors. So for my macOS colors, I use
their stock purple, which nicely affects everything else in the
system. Otherwise, I prefer darker themes with candy-like secondary colors to
balance everything.

All right, bye! 😘
