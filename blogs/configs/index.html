I like having my computers and tools tailor-made to suit my tastes and wants. It makes me feel at home. When I see my favorite collection of colors, contrasts, and schemas, it feels right. It might not be the best approach for your productivity, as you would spend the first couple of hours to a couple of days fine-tuning whatever you have in front of you to your liking. Yet, I believe there is value in bending anything and everything to feel at home.

In the past, I made a <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/config-files" title="">config files</a> repository, where I stored all my cool Linux dotfiles, <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/using_mutt/" title="">mutt stuff</a>, custom shell scripts for <a href="http://acme.cat-v.org" title="">acme</a>, and more... This is all in the past now. I was still in high school. Then, I made a <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/dotfiles" title="">new repository</a>, which I conveniently named <em>dotfiles</em> to replace <em>config-files</em>. <strong>What a novel idea!</strong> However, I quickly fall out of the habit of manually updating the configs or using special programs that take a list of target files and hard symlink before pushing updates. Why not write them out on a page on my website with pictures and all the cool stuff?

<h1 id="terminal" class="section-2">Terminal</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<strong>THiS iS ExcItINg</strong>. First of all, I have to start with my colors and preferences for the terminal. I like darker backgrounds and brighter foregrounds. But not too bright. White on black is one sure way to strain your eyes with a one-way ticket. All the <em>cool hackers</em> like the ‚Äúgreen-on-black,‚Äù which I think looks incredibly tacky and hardly legible. Unless you convince yourself otherwise. Many developers I was never too fond of always used this matrix color scheme.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I‚Äôm sorry, it doesn‚Äôt make you look cool or feel like it. I know it because I have also had it as my terminal for years. It is something you need to grow out of. I like the <em>classy</em> ‚Äúorange-on-black‚Äù balance, which gives off nice <a href="https://youtu.be/Y6ljFaKRTrI" title="">Portal - <em>Still Alive</em></a> vibes. Here are my preferred colors: <code>#ffd000</code> for foreground, <code>#000000</code> for background, <code>#a466a5</code> for selection, and <code>#f4f4f4</code> for selected text. As a sheltered macOS user, I use <a href="https://iterm2.com" title="">iTerm2</a>. In Todd Howard‚Äôs fashion, ‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù

Portal is a great game.

<h1 id="font" class="section-2">Font</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Oh, and yeah. Forgot about the fonts. I always use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_(typeface)" title="">Monaco</a> for Sans-serif monospace fonts when coding and such. Unfortunately, Apple didn‚Äôt think of including the bold variant with their default systems, so there is <a href="https://github.com/vjpr/monaco-bold" title="">this patch</a>, which will get you the Monaco font with a bold-variant.

<h1 id="emacs" class="section-2">Emacs</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Emacs is next. Oh, emacs. How long have we been together? I think it is around the fifth or sixth year now. The longest relationship I have had with any software. Emacs‚Äôs been there through thick and thin. In my lonely nights as a college student, stressful afternoons at work, and lovely mornings of focus. We have shared a sacred bond ‚Äì a <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/emacs.sh/" title="">mutual config file</a> that we have already been maintaining for many years. Here is to our friendship, camaraderie, and fruitful partnership.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
With a preface like that, the way emacs feels and looks is meaningful to me. Very much so. Spending hours looking at a screen should bring you joy and the kind that lasts for years. For the looks, I primarily depend on the <strong>fantastic</strong> Andre Richter‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/andre-richter/emacs-lush-theme" title="">emacs-lush-theme</a>, which in turn is inspired by <a href="http://jdhuntington.com/paste/color-theme-blackboard.el.html" title="">JD Huntington‚Äôs blackboard theme</a>. I have some <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/.emacs.d/#org1019aa6" title="">custom faces</a> added in for LSP integrations and such. Of course, I cannot miss the fantastic work done by <a href="https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs" title="">nano-emacs</a>, who brings the elegance of modern UIs to emacs. I forked <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/.emacs.d/#orgd5b797e" title="">my version</a> of it a long time ago, which I‚Äôve been happily using for years.

<h1 id="intellij-idea" class="section-2">IntelliJ IDEA</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
IntelliJ is one of those things that I refuse to believe exist because it makes me concerned whether they are tapping directly into my brain when I‚Äôm writing some of that sweet Java. Phenomenal IDE with state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/05/debugger-basics-in-intellij-idea/" title="">debugger</a>, freaky <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html" title="">code completion</a>, and much more. I only found one fatal flaw with the software ‚Äì it didn‚Äôt have a theme I liked. They do have a plugin, which <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10804-the-doki-theme" title="">puts an anime girl</a> in the bottom right of the screen with accompanying color schemes. It‚Äôs <em>kinda</em> cool.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
But that is not what I‚Äôm looking for. Creating themes for IntelliJ is <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/themes.html#completing-the-default-ui-theme-description-file" title="">too hard</a>. What I did instead is I found a theme I liked on its principles ‚Äì <em>Lotus Dark</em> from <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14369-lotus-theme" title="">Lotus Theme</a>. Later, I adapted <code>lush-theme</code> from emacs using color schemes and called it <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/najimi-jetbrains" title="">najimi-jetbrains</a>. Now, I feel safe once again.

The color scheme is currently meant for Java codebases. I might add other languages if I feel like it one morning.

<p>
I love pink, purple, and all the adjacent colors. So for my macOS colors, I use their stock purple, which nicely affects everything else in the system. Otherwise, I prefer darker themes with candy-like secondary colors to balance everything.
