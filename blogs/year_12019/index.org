* Welcome to year 12,019 üìÖ

** Abstract
This is a converted version of my speech I gave at my public speaking class in
college. You can find the original document [[../../documents/20190500-Year-2019.pdf][here]].
This speech is meant to persuade its audience. I truly believe that changing the
current marking method of history can shift the way we thenx and perceive
ourselves. The idea itself was greatly inspired by Kurzgesagt's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs][famous
video]]. Enjoy!

Hello there. My name is Sandy and I want to talk with you about our current Gregorian calendar and
the reasons why we might consider switching to a new calendar system. In this persuasive speech, I
will introduce you to the Gregorian Calendar, its inconsistencies, and a better alternative to it.

/[Let's get started!]/

Our current Gregorian calendar is the most used calendar in the world. It was introduced by
Pope Gregory XIII in October 1582. Each year roughly elapses to 365 days.

The Gregorian Calendar includes two eras in itself: BC and AD. According to Merriam-Webster
dictionary, BC stands for "before Christ" and AD roughly translates from Latin "Anno Domini"
to "in the year of our Lord".
[fn:: Merriam-Webster, _Anno Domini_ (2019). Accessed April 13.]
The current year 2019 can be fully expanded as the year 2019 after birth of Christ or AD 2019.
Due to an ongoing and ever active globalization, the calendar was even adopted by most of the
non-Western countries. It is truly, the dominant way of understanding time and our history.
The question rises, does it necessarily mean it is the best one?

/[As we learned about the Gregorian calendar, let's see where it lacks consistency.]/

The Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar before it are very much centered around
the birth of Jesus of Nazareth.
[fn:: Geza Vermes in _Jesus the Jew: A historian‚Äôs reading of the Gospels_ (1973).]
Firstly, current calendar's system of year counting is computationally and conceptually
confusing when we want to get to the fundamental levels. There is no year 0 in the Gregorian
calendar, so the difference between 1.5 BC and AD 1.5 is 1 year instead of 3. And BC era does
not have a year 0 either.
Secondly, the current calendar explicitly accounts only to around two thousand years of our human
history which itself is a tiny part of our actual history.

/[What is one of the possible solutions to resolve the current calendar's problems?]/

In 1993, Italian-American scientist Cesare Emiliani proposed a new calendar in the Nature journal
article "Calendar Reform".
[fn:: Cesare Emiliani, ‚ÄúCalendar Reform,‚Äù _Nature_, University of Miami (1993).]
In his article, Professor Emiliani proposes that the beginning of calendrical time could be set
at the beginning of the current Julian Cycle, 4,713 BC, established by Joseph Scalinger and still
used by astronomers. To simplify the arithmetic, round 10,000 years could be added to the current
AD year), ultimately converting 2019 AD to 12,019 HE. Setting the birth of Christ at 25 December
of the year 10,000 from the beginning of Human Era. Adding a round number to the current date
conserves all established holidays, months, and days. However it adds a whole another level
of understanding of our human civilization. Let us take a brief look at our history from the
beginning of Human Era.

/[After merely 2 thousand years after, here we are.]/

If we keep thinking about our history as we do now, we underplay almost 10 thousand years of
human progress and development. Human Era incorporates all humans from all cultures and races.
By only moving our point of reference, the year zero, we can fundamentally reframe the way we
perceive ourselves. We can truly understand where we came from and be proud of who we are today.
Only by knowing and respecting our past, we can have a clear vision into the future beyond the skies.

/[Thank you for your attention. Let's live in our new mindset and expand our horizons.]/
