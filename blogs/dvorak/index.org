* Switching to dvorak layout ðŸŽ¹

50; 12022 H.E. 

I switched to Dvorak layout in the summer of 2018. That was a very important
time for me, as a couple of months after, I would start my first year in
college. Why did I decide to switch to Dvorak and do I still use it four years
later? Let us walk through it quickly.

First things first, let me run a quick introduction to the layout. The overwhelming
majority of people use a QWERTY keyboard layout, which is currently the de facto
standard keyboard layout. Many people that use it don't even know that there are
other layouts possible. The only way you know you use QWERTY is by looking at
the first 6 letters in the top left of your keyboard.

If QWERTY is used by almost everyone in the world, it's the accepted
international standard and every physical keyboard in existence is built using
the layout, why would I or anyone else ever think about switching out of it?
There can be several, but you have to make sure those reasons would apply
to you and you could benefit from them.

The big part of why I switched out was my inability to touch type on QWERTY,
largely because I never learned how to type "the right way". I
think I learned how to type on my parents' old computer, where I would type by
looking at all the keycaps, where my fingers would go smashing them violently. I
never trained myself out of it, so even farther into my adolescence and fiery
teenage years, I typed a little slow and needed constant visual assistance.

When I took upon learning Dvorak, I spent the first week or so completely
crippled and unable to type anything faster than one keypress every 2-3
seconds. I would constantly look up the key positions on my phone (why would I
move the keycaps) and try to memorize their positions as much as possible,
before it bleeds into my muscle memory.

About two or three weeks later, I could confidently, not exuberantly, but
confidently type in Dvorak at the same speed as I did when using QWERTY. A month
or so after, it just became second nature to me. Four years after, never looked
back. I have been a happy daily Dvorak user for years and more to come. Right as
this backstory ended, let's talk about some advantages Dvorak can bring you in
your day-to-day-in-front-of-the-computer-typing-life.

The big part of why Dvorak is semi-popular is thanks to its more ergonomic key
and letter placement compared to QWERTY. Most used letters, such as "aoeuidhtns"
are located on your home row (the middle one), such that your fingers have to
travel less distance in less time to reach the desired key. On QWERTY, however,
they are spread out all over the keymap, which makes you run like a wild rabbit,
chasing those keystrokes.

This difference in ergonomic key placement is very important. On QWERTY, you
only spend about 30% of your time on the home row, whereas Dvorak keeps you
70% close to it. We can observe that Dvorak could be at least 40% more
productive, as it reduces the amount of space you have to traverse when
typing. Taking just that into account, /you would be a faster typer/ using Dvorak
instead of QWERTY.

How does it feel typing? I'm doing it right now as I did for years and
it is very comfortable. Letters and their positions feel more natural, like
dancing a ballet instead of running around like a wild rabbit. Just to sum it
up, I would recommend trying Dvorak out if you feel your wrists hurt when
typing for a long time or you never learned to touch-type QWERTY. Be crazy.

I was applying for a tech internship and had a scheduled on-site interview,
where I had to code some stuff up on their laptops. I did forget that normal
people use QWERTY, and I forget how to type it after not touching it for
months. It was a funny moment, where this software engineering applicant doesn't
know how to type on a keyboard. I simply asked if I could quickly switch the
layout (incredibly easy on macs) and we all had a good laugh.
