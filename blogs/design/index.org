* How I worked on my design 🥐

80; 12022 H.E.

This website has gone through many different iterations, looks, tools, and
contents. I thought it would be a nice exercise to quickly, yet cleanly outline
some of the inspirations I took from other blogs/websites and where does the
current style comes from.  

** The beginning 

I looked up sandyuraz.com on the [[https://web.archive.org/web/*/sandyuraz.com][Wayback Machine]] and there are a couple of
snapshots saved up! I picked the ones that clearly show some changes and updates
that were made over time. This is the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200509100353/http://sandyuraz.com/][oldest snapshot]] found in the archive. It's
a plain website built with [[https://asciidoctor.org][asciidoctor]]. It was very nice in the beginning! I
wrote a couple of markdown documents, and boom, I have a website.  

#+html_tags: style="width:40rem";
[[snap1.webp][The oldest snapshot]]

Later on, I wanted to write my website files in org-mode instead of
markdown-like asciidoc text files. That's [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/web-legacy/][when]] I came up with this wicked
structure of having a [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/Makefile][huge makefile]] that will call [[https://pandoc.org][pandoc]] on each file,
converting org to asciidoc, and finally piping it to asciidoctor for a final
build. It was fun until it wasn't.  

The pipeline of =org->asciidoc->HTML= had a flaw of losing information, simply
because some features were not supported or translated poorly. I had to write
many additional sed/awk scripts to patch them up. Yet, there was no superb
control of the output. I was okay with that. It worked, duh  

NOTE: You can notice that I still used keybase in that first snapshot

** Bookshelf 

Adding the bookshelf page to my website was a grand addition I came up with
sometime in the summer of 2020? I remember I was reading some blog from hacker
news. Unfortunately, couldn't find the link to the source. She had a nice
navigation button that just read *Books*. "Interesting," I thought.  

They had a list of books they've read that link to their respective
reviews. Another list on top had the "currently reading" books. I thought it was
such a nice section for a website. I like to read. Though, I wanted to add a
little bit of a spice to it. Around that time I also discovered [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode][Artist Mode]] for
emacs.  

Why can't I just make ASCII drawings of books stacked on top of each other, just
like my current library? Here is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200925133247/https://sandyuraz.com/books/][the snapshot]] that recorded that moment. I still
want to add a review section to my bookshelf, but [[https://sandyuraz.com/anime/][anime]] came first.

** Fortunes 

Donald Ray Burger with his famous burger.com has a separate page for [[http://burger.com/quotenow.htm][Quote of
the Week]], which he's been upkeeping since 2010 (oldest I could find, maybe goes
even deeper). In my mind, it was such a cool idea to post a quote or a saying
you liked and can look back on it. I used to do that in my notebook, but a whole
website page sounds *generational*.  

Here is the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200925123757/https://sandyuraz.com/fortunes/][earliest snapshot]] I could find for it.

** Foundation time 

I like the [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/year_12019/][Human Era]] calendar and I love Asimov, wherein one of his /Foundation/
books he used a [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/foundation-time/][Galactic timestamp]] format. Why not combine the two? I made a
quick [[https://sandyuraz.com/time][webpage]] that shows you the current Human Era time in Foundation
format. Why not add it to the main website? But how...  

[[https://www.nytimes.com][The New York Times]] website and app have a nice timestamp that shows what day it
is today. Let me do a similar thing, but show the human era in foundation
style. That's how [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/master/scripts/time.js][this script]] came to life, which updates the current time every
second on every page. Added [[https://web.archive.org/web/20210124212647/https://sandyuraz.com/][sometime]] in 12021 H.E.  

** Toddler-friendly 

One of my friends told me, "Hey Sandy, I opened your website, but it was hard to
navigate and read stuff, so much on it." To which I replied promptly, "Okay,
I'll make it so simple that even toddlers can navigate through it." This was a
good (great) change.  

I coupled up all pages, interests, movies, habits, projects, and posts into
their separate subsections and made the main page a collection of links that
leads users to the section they're interested in. Compared to now, it [[https://web.archive.org/web/20210506184205/https://sandyuraz.com/][looks
bland]]. Humble beginnings.

** Mahjong 

Donald Knuth has a [[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/][weird symbol]] on every section link, so that's why I have
mahjong Unicode characters in the sections' titles.  

** My face 

Another inspiration I yoinked from Donald Knuth is having a [[https://web.archive.org/web/20210612140549/https://sandyuraz.com/][profile picture]] on
the top left content corner of your website. "That looks good! I'm not face-shy
anymore. I think I had a good selfie somewhere..."

#+html_tags: style="width:40rem";
[[face.webp][👋 hi]]

** Serif fonts 

Wow, this was [[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/07/01/dostoevsky-and-his-demons/][one of the best]] essays I have ever read. Not only it's a fantastic
study of Dostoyevsky's life, but also the reading experience was simply
pleasant. Something about the font and wide margins...  

The non-commercial license for nybooks' font costs [[https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/ivar-text/][€440]]. This is a bit much for
a 20-year old, who just wants to write his musings on his website. I went on
digging and found the amazing [[https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/lora][Lora]], which was a match made in heavens. A
gorgeous serif font, it's thick, bold, and confident. Let me adjust my margins
and everything font-related to make it [[https://web.archive.org/web/20211115060630/https://sandyuraz.com/][look sexier]].

** Najimi Colors 

I still have the default asciidoctor colors, mainly just the links and orange
titles. [[https://sandyuraz.com/anime/komi/][I live for Najimi]] and they have more of a purple/pink-ish appearance,
which looks *so good*. Time to change the palette to have the pink shade of my
duvet cover.  

[[najimi.webp][Najimi's color palette]]

** Darkness 

All of the above was leading up to this point. I observed there is no longer a
reason for me to have my face sticking out, it does nothing. I want to express
myself better and have fun, [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/living/][live consciously]]. A full revamp was comparable to a
fresh spring air in the morning. New previews, new emojis, new building
pipeline, new interests, new people, and new adventures! Life is indeed grand.

[[darkness.webp][I love Darkness]]

NOTE: The website went through a small but significant design update, like a
fully re-written CSS, reader-friendly DOM layout, simpler HTML structure, and
more!

** New links

I loved the website and link design of [[https://asteriskmag.com/][Asterisk]] journal. Moving away from a full
block-ish links, the links now are nice to look an click at. 

** Galleries

One of the biggest features that landed in Darkness were native
galleries. Through some ~#+begin_gallery~ magic, you can have [[https://sandyuraz.com/shokugeki/][beautiful tiles]]
spread around the page. This is heavily inspired by [[https://github.com/itorr][itorr]]'s [[https://i.magiconch.com/pvc][pvc page]].

** Let it snow!

December 22nd was the Day of Reckoning here in Kansas. Literally -32C in the
afternoon like it's nothing. I misread my weather forecast, thinking it's /only/
-5C outside. I went to the office (walked lmao) and in couple of minutes all I
could do was scream and yell until I got to the building.

So... enjoy some snow on the website using [[https://github.com/scottschiller][Scott Schiller's]] [[http://www.schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm/][snowstorm]].

** Tighter design

Around the beginning of August, 2023, I decided to give the website's design a
bit more discipline and /love/. It's been a hot second since I had a time or
really, energg to sit down and do something for myself. (I'm good, I promise.)

First thing I thought---I love the color scheme, but over the years, they kind
of washed out on me and it feels a bit too bright, especially bg of
=#fffff4=. After a tiny bit of exploring and soul-searching, I [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/ebce44f24fa96b06b6b85c47df16f2b7eb506dd2][found]] the new
*perfect* background color---=#fdf5f5=.

It's softer than the previous one, has a bit more tone to it, a bit more warmth,
yet not too dark or distractingly ``sepia''.

#+html_tags: style="width:44rem";
[[website_august_2023.webp][The homepage with the new color scheme]]

The font got a [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/465be007d43ca380b6d839c3ca99f1aab7853f18][bit bigger]] (=1.3rem= -> =1.32rem=) and the spacing between lines went
down from =2.2rem= to =2rem=. It feels more organized and ``newspaper-like,'' but in
a good way. /I hope/. 

Also! Each image on the website got a /bit/ wider, but it *really* breaks square
images or vertical proportions, as those become a screen-scrolling adventure for
the user, which is not desired. Instead, /Darkness/ now allows to [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/b5287a3730318cd4c0e3c1960de80ae3d7651f99][resize any image]]
on the page without the need for anything special or clevel. Adding an option
tag above the image,

#+begin_src
#+html_tags: style="width:44rem";
[[website_august_2023.webp][The homepage with the new color scheme]]
#+end_src

will size it up exactly as you need it.
