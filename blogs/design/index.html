<p>
This website has gone through many different iterations, looks, tools, and contents. I thought it would be a nice exercise to quickly, yet cleanly outline some of the inspirations I took from other blogs/websites and where does the current style comes from.
</p>
</div>
<h1 id="the-beginning" class="section-2">The beginning</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I looked up sandyuraz.com on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/sandyuraz.com" title="">Wayback Machine</a> and there are a couple of snapshots saved up! I picked the ones that clearly show some changes and updates that were made over time. This is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200509100353/http://sandyuraz.com/" title="">oldest snapshot</a> found in the archive. It’s a plain website built with <a href="https://asciidoctor.org" title="">asciidoctor</a>. It was very nice in the beginning! I wrote a couple of markdown documents, and boom, I have a website.
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="media" style="width:40rem";>
<a class="image" ><img class="image" src="snap1.webp" title="The oldest snapshot" alt="The oldest snapshot"></a>
<div class="title">The oldest snapshot</div>
<hr>
</div><div class="writing">

<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Later on, I wanted to write my website files in org-mode instead of markdown-like asciidoc text files. That’s <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/web-legacy/" title="">when</a> I came up with this wicked structure of having a <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/Makefile" title="">huge makefile</a> that will call <a href="https://pandoc.org" title="">pandoc</a> on each file, converting org to asciidoc, and finally piping it to asciidoctor for a final build. It was fun until it wasn’t.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
The pipeline of <code>org-&gt;asciidoc-&gt;HTML</code> had a flaw of losing information, simply because some features were not supported or translated poorly. I had to write many additional sed/awk scripts to patch them up. Yet, there was no superb control of the output. I was okay with that. It worked, duh

<h1 id="bookshelf" class="section-2">Bookshelf</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Adding the bookshelf page to my website was a grand addition I came up with sometime in the summer of 2020? I remember I was reading some blog from hacker news. Unfortunately, couldn’t find the link to the source. She had a nice navigation button that just read <strong>Books</strong>. &#34;Interesting,&#34; I thought.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
They had a list of books they’ve read that link to their respective reviews. Another list on top had the &#34;currently reading&#34; books. I thought it was such a nice section for a website. I like to read. Though, I wanted to add a little bit of a spice to it. Around that time I also discovered <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode" title="">Artist Mode</a> for emacs.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Why can’t I just make ASCII drawings of books stacked on top of each other, just like my current library? Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200925133247/https://sandyuraz.com/books/" title="">the snapshot</a> that recorded that moment. I still want to add a review section to my bookshelf, but <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/anime/" title="">anime</a> came first.

<p>
Donald Ray Burger with his famous burger.com has a separate page for <a href="http://burger.com/quotenow.htm" title="">Quote of the Week</a>, which he’s been upkeeping since 2010 (oldest I could find, maybe goes even deeper). In my mind, it was such a cool idea to post a quote or a saying you liked and can look back on it. I used to do that in my notebook, but a whole website page sounds <strong>generational</strong>.

<h1 id="foundation-time" class="section-2">Foundation time</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I like the <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/year_12019/" title="">Human Era</a> calendar and I love Asimov, wherein one of his <em>Foundation</em> books he used a <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/foundation-time/" title="">Galactic timestamp</a> format. Why not combine the two? I made a quick <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/time" title="">webpage</a> that shows you the current Human Era time in Foundation format. Why not add it to the main website? But how...
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com" title="">The New York Times</a> website and app have a nice timestamp that shows what day it is today. Let me do a similar thing, but show the human era in foundation style. That’s how <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/master/scripts/time.js" title="">this script</a> came to life, which updates the current time every second on every page. Added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124212647/https://sandyuraz.com/" title="">sometime</a> in 12021 H.E.

<h1 id="toddler-friendly" class="section-2">Toddler-friendly</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
One of my friends told me, &#34;Hey Sandy, I opened your website, but it was hard to navigate and read stuff, so much on it.&#34; To which I replied promptly, &#34;Okay, I’ll make it so simple that even toddlers can navigate through it.&#34; This was a good (great) change.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I coupled up all pages, interests, movies, habits, projects, and posts into their separate subsections and made the main page a collection of links that leads users to the section they’re interested in. Compared to now, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210506184205/https://sandyuraz.com/" title="">looks bland</a>. Humble beginnings.

<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Donald Knuth has a <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/" title="">weird symbol</a> on every section link, so that’s why I have mahjong Unicode characters in the sections’ titles.

<h1 id="my-face" class="section-2">My face</h1>

Another inspiration I yoinked from Donald Knuth is having a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210612140549/https://sandyuraz.com/" title="">profile picture</a> on the top left content corner of your website. &#34;That looks good! I’m not face-shy anymore. I think I had a good selfie somewhere...&#34;

<p>
Wow, this was <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/07/01/dostoevsky-and-his-demons/" title="">one of the best</a> essays I have ever read. Not only it’s a fantastic study of Dostoyevsky’s life, but also the reading experience was simply pleasant. Something about the font and wide margins...
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
The non-commercial license for nybooks’ font costs <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/ivar-text/" title="">€440</a>. This is a bit much for a 20-year old, who just wants to write his musings on his website. I went on digging and found the amazing <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/lora" title="">Lora</a>, which was a match made in heavens. A gorgeous serif font, it’s thick, bold, and confident. Let me adjust my margins and everything font-related to make it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211115060630/https://sandyuraz.com/" title="">look sexier</a>.

<h1 id="najimi-colors" class="section-2">Najimi Colors</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I still have the default asciidoctor colors, mainly just the links and orange titles. <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/anime/komi/" title="">I live for Najimi</a> and they have more of a purple/pink-ish appearance, which looks <strong>so good</strong>. Time to change the palette to have the pink shade of my duvet cover.

All of the above was leading up to this point. I observed there is no longer a reason for me to have my face sticking out, it does nothing. I want to express myself better and have fun, <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/living/" title="">live consciously</a>. A full revamp was comparable to a fresh spring air in the morning. New previews, new emojis, new building pipeline, new interests, new people, and new adventures! Life is indeed grand.

<h1 id="galleries" class="section-2">Galleries</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
One of the biggest features that landed in Darkness were native galleries. Through some <code>#+begin_gallery</code> magic, you can have <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/shokugeki/" title="">beautiful tiles</a> spread around the page. This is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/itorr" title="">itorr</a>’s <a href="https://i.magiconch.com/pvc" title="">pvc page</a>.

<h1 id="let-it-snow" class="section-2">Let it snow!</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
December 22nd was the Day of Reckoning here in Kansas. Literally -32C in the afternoon like it’s nothing. I misread my weather forecast, thinking it’s <em>only</em> -5C outside. I went to the office (walked lmao) and in couple of minutes all I could do was scream and yell until I got to the building.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
So... enjoy some snow on the website using <a href="https://github.com/scottschiller" title="">Scott Schiller’s</a> <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm/" title="">snowstorm</a>.

<h1 id="tighter-design" class="section-2">Tighter design</h1>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Around the beginning of August, 2023, I decided to give the website’s design a bit more discipline and <em>love</em>. It’s been a hot second since I had a time or really, energg to sit down and do something for myself. (I’m good, I promise.)
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
First thing I thought—I love the color scheme, but over the years, they kind of washed out on me and it feels a bit too bright, especially bg of <code>#fffff4</code>. After a tiny bit of exploring and soul-searching, I <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/ebce44f24fa96b06b6b85c47df16f2b7eb506dd2" title="">found</a> the new <strong>perfect</strong> background color—<code>#f1ded1</code>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
It’s softer than the previous one, has a bit more tone to it, a bit more warmth, yet not too dark or distractingly “sepia”.

<div class="title">The homepage with the new color scheme</div>

<p>
The font got a <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/465be007d43ca380b6d839c3ca99f1aab7853f18" title="">bit bigger</a> (<code>1.3rem</code> -&gt; <code>1.32rem</code>) and the spacing between lines went down from <code>2.2rem</code> to <code>2rem</code>. It feels more organized and “newspaper-like,” but in a good way. <em>I hope</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Also! Each image on the website got a <em>bit</em> wider, but it <strong>really</strong> breaks square images or vertical proportions, as those become a screen-scrolling adventure for the user, which is not desired. Instead, <em>Darkness</em> now allows to <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/b5287a3730318cd4c0e3c1960de80ae3d7651f99" title="">resize any image</a> on the page without the need for anything special or clevel.
