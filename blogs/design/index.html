This website has gone through many different iterations, looks, tools, and contents. I thought it would be a nice exercise to quickly, yet cleanly outline some of the inspirations I took from other blogs/websites and where does the current style comes from.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_beginning">The beginning</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I looked up sandyuraz.com on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/sandyuraz.com">Wayback Machine</a> and there are a couple of snapshots saved up! I picked the ones that clearly show some changes and updates that were made over time. This is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200509100353/http://sandyuraz.com/">oldest snapshot</a> found in the archive. It‚Äôs a plain website built with <a href="https://asciidoctor.org">asciidoctor</a>. It was very nice in the beginning! I wrote a couple of markdown documents, and boom, I have a website.
</p>

<div class="title">The oldest snapshot</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Later on, I wanted to write my website files in org-mode instead of markdown-like asciidoc text files. That‚Äôs <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/web-legacy/">when</a> I came up with this wicked structure of having a <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/Makefile">huge makefile</a> that will call <a href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc</a> on each file, converting org to asciidoc, and finally piping it to asciidoctor for a final build. It was fun until it wasn‚Äôt.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The pipeline of <code>org-&gt;asciidoc-&gt;HTML</code> had a flaw of losing information, simply because some features were not supported or translated poorly. I had to write many additional sed/awk scripts to patch them up. Yet, there was no superb control of the output. I was okay with that. It worked, duh

<p>
Adding the bookshelf page to my website was a grand addition I came up with sometime in the summer of 2020? I remember I was reading some blog from hacker news. Unfortunately, couldn‚Äôt find the link to the source. She had a nice navigation button that just read <strong>Books</strong>. &#34;Interesting,&#34; I thought.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
They had a list of books they&#39;ve read that link to their respective reviews. Another list on top had the &#34;currently reading&#34; books. I thought it was such a nice section for a website. I like to read. Though, I wanted to add a little bit of a spice to it. Around that time I also discovered <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode">Artist Mode</a> for emacs.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Why can‚Äôt I just make ASCII drawings of books stacked on top of each other, just like my current library? Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200925133247/https://sandyuraz.com/books/">the snapshot</a> that recorded that moment. I still want to add a review section to my bookshelf, but <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/anime/">anime</a> came first.

<p>
Donald Ray Burger with his famous burger.com has a separate page for <a href="http://burger.com/quotenow.htm">Quote of the Week</a>, which he‚Äôs been upkeeping since 2010 (oldest I could find, maybe goes even deeper). In my mind, it was such a cool idea to post a quote or a saying you liked and can look back on it. I used to do that in my notebook, but a whole website page sounds <strong>generational</strong>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Here is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200925123757/https://sandyuraz.com/fortunes/">earliest snapshot</a> I could find for it.

<h2 id="_foundation_time">Foundation time</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I like the <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/year_12019/">Human Era</a> calendar and I love Asimov, wherein one of his <em>Foundation</em> books he used a <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/foundation-time/">Galactic timestamp</a> format. Why not combine the two? I made a quick <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/time">webpage</a> that shows you the current Human Era time in Foundation format. Why not add it to the main website? But how...
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> website and app have a nice timestamp that shows what day it is today. Let me do a similar thing, but show the human era in foundation style. That‚Äôs how <a href="https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/master/scripts/time.js">this script</a> came to life, which updates the current time every second on every page. Added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124212647/https://sandyuraz.com/">sometime</a> in 12021 H.E.

<p>
One of my friends told me, &#34;Hey Sandy, I opened your website, but it was hard to navigate and read stuff, so much on it.&#34; To which I replied promptly, &#34;Okay, I‚Äôll make it so simple that even toddlers can navigate through it.&#34; This was a good (great) change.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I coupled up all pages, interests, movies, habits, projects, and posts into their separate subsections and made the main page a collection of links that leads users to the section they‚Äôre interested in. Compared to now, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210506184205/https://sandyuraz.com/">looks bland</a>. Humble beginnings.

<p>
Donald Knuth has a <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">weird symbol</a> on every section link, so that‚Äôs why I have mahjong Unicode characters in the sections&#39; titles.

Another inspiration I yoinked from Donald Knuth is having a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210612140549/https://sandyuraz.com/">profile picture</a> on the top left content corner of your website. &#34;That looks good! I‚Äôm not face-shy anymore. I think I had a good selfie somewhere...&#34;

<p>
Wow, this was <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/07/01/dostoevsky-and-his-demons/">one of the best</a> essays I have ever read. Not only it‚Äôs a fantastic study of Dostoyevsky‚Äôs life, but also the reading experience was simply pleasant. Something about the font and wide margins...
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The non-commercial license for nybooks&#39; font costs <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/ivar-text/">‚Ç¨440</a>. This is a bit much for a 20-year old, who just wants to write his musings on his website. I went on digging and found the amazing <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/lora">Lora</a>, which was a match made in heavens. A gorgeous serif font, it‚Äôs thick, bold, and confident. Let me adjust my margins and everything font-related to make it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211115060630/https://sandyuraz.com/">look sexier</a>.

<h2 id="_najimi_colors">Najimi Colors</h2>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
I still have the default asciidoctor colors, mainly just the links and orange titles. <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/anime/komi/">I live for Najimi</a> and they have more of a purple/pink-ish appearance, which looks <strong>so good</strong>. Time to change the palette to have the pink shade of my duvet cover.

All of the above was leading up to this point. I observed there is no longer a reason for me to have my face sticking out, it does nothing. I want to express myself better and have fun, <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/living/">live consciously</a>. A full revamp was comparable to a fresh spring air in the morning. New previews, new emojis, new building pipeline, new interests, new people, and new adventures! Life is indeed grand.
