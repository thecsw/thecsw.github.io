I wish to talk here with you about aesthetics and fine art. Some things we might enjoy alone or together! Historically, my website had different sections for my favorite films, songs, shows, etc. I thought it would be nice to wrap them all up together and call it &#34;Les Arts&#34;. This page should be able to present my interests and hobbies in a more centralized and coherent manner.
</p>

Let us get books and reading out of the way. After trying out almost every genre of book, I found out what tickles and touches me in all the right ways. Russian Classical Literature, primarily 19th century, including but not limited to Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Chekhov, Bulgakov, etc. As my public speaking professor put, &#34;Only Russian Literature has made the venture into who we are, the core within us. While all the other went external.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Of course, this does not limit me from enjoying any other genre. I love Asimov, some medieval literature (Beowulf is a great example), classical philosophy (I adore Voltaire), and something in between. Tao of Pooh is also a fantastic work of literature.

Movies... probably watched too many for my age. In some ways, like Eugene Onegin, I became very much disinterested in them, even to the extent of repulsion by the new cinema scene. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to explain, but all the comedy is the new tragedy and what is supposed to be tragic is something to laugh at. Arts should help us to define ourselves, our taste in fine things. However, all I see now is just... unwatchable.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Though I do not want to end the movies part on such a sad note. Here are my favorite movies that I tend to rewatch dozens of times: The Godfather I and II (probably best cinema ever), Gone with the Wind (no better tragedy/romance, almost felt like War and Peace), 2001: A Space Odyssey (the grandfather of Science-Fiction), La La Land (good contemporary musical)... I can‚Äôt even remember the rest, though I always knew them by heart. Oh well, those listed above are really good (completely subjective).

From films to shows. Not a whole lot different from what we&#39;ve talked about before. Maybe I just became cynical towards everything new, oh well. I guess that happened a little too soon than I have anticipated. I wanted to watch some shows with my friends and then-girlfriend, but what‚Äôs supposed to be funny is just sad (how the misery of others is just a funny trope) and low taste. There are a couple that is dear to my heart: Pride and Prejudice (1995 by BBC1), Twin Peaks (can‚Äôt watch it anymore), Boston Legal (good 2000s), Neon Genesis Evangelion (there was a month in my life where I actively watched anime), and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (Who the hell do you think I am?!).

Last but not least, music! We always talk about each other‚Äôs taste in music, our favorite artists, groups, etc. I&#39;ve always had a hard time answering that, simply because I just wasn‚Äôt exposed to a lot of personal listening when I was younger. When I did though, fell in love with Daft Punk (love you forever). After playing a lot of Fallout: New Vegas, I had a walkman with the 50s and 60s country loaded onto it. Big Iron! Later, I made a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3kEBOeXVLWG3Y8P3KUEn1a?si=8bcd5d952f7d4011">spotify playlist</a> with the banging 80s, 90s, and wild 2000s. I have to confess, now I just limit myself to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ZZv8ppIChHJeNoj5rW3oC?si=18b24d7ae7174973">alyonna</a>, my main playlist that contains all sorts of classical and waltz works. <b style="color:#ba3925">‚óºÔ∏é</b>
