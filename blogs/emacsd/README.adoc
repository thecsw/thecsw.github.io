= Setting up an emacs server ðŸ˜ˆ

May 8th, 2020

Booting up emacs can be a challenging task for your terminal emulator
and the rock that you tricked into thinking. This is a quick guide with
some pointers on speeding up your emacs interactions 100x. No joke.

== Emacs daemon

Starting the emacs daeman cannot be even simpler, just type this in your
favorite shell

[source,bash]
----
% emacs --daemon
----

It should build all your .el config scripts and boot up your own emacs
server.

== Emacsclient

Now to access and open your emacs daemon, just type in

[source,bash]
----
% emacsclient -nw
----

_I really prefer terminal client_ and you're done! Notice that the load
was almost instantaneous. Instead of loading your whole emacs config, it
just redraws the screen.

== Killing daemon

Who doesn't want to slaughter a daemon in cold blood? That's a
rhetorical question. `emaclient` can execute a kill command for the
daemon

[source,bash]
----
% emacsclient -e "(kill-emacs)"
----

== Shell aliases

`emacsclient` can get old real quick. I like adding super simple aliases
for faster opening

* **bash** - put `alias em = "emacsclient -nw"` in `_/.bashrc`
* **fish** - put `alias em = "emacsclient -nw"` in
`_/.config/fish/config.fish`

== Systemd daemon

You can also set emacs daemon to start automatically by adding systemctl
symlinks. More information on
