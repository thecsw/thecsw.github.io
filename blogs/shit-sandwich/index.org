* Against shit sandwiches 🥙

#+begin_quote
You did a fantastic, really, phenomenal job on this. Simply, incredible. This piece
though is a hot pile of garbage, it sucks ass, and it stinks. I'm sure it's no
big deal though. I mean, listen, whatever we can get to, it would be amazing.

Great. Thanks. I *love* eating shit sandwiches. Nothing better than getting
buttered up, coddled with, given a somewhat real but pent-up with a sprinkle of
self-righteousness feedback, immediately followed by a softening of the
blow---since, who wants to lose face---and settle on some of the most mediocre
compromise possible, because everybody has to be happy. No. Matter. What.

Having lived in a corporate environment---I promise, this is not coming from my
current work, but through some other fruitful avenues---you get handed at least
one of those every day. The resulting product ends up being total garbage that
no side of the bread wants, but everybody is now stuck with it. In the realm of
the good ideas on both sides, those who wager wars, always find themselves right
in the middle of it, where nobody is happy and the decisions made could not have
come from a worse parallel universe that birthed them into existence.

Scrolling through Goodreads one day, I stumbled upon a review from an old
acquaintance on a book that I have never heard of, never read, and never
planning to. However, the writing and thoughts expressed were so bland
that I simply had to say something about it. It irked me in such a way
that shaking it off proved to be an annoying exercise of in itself. So, to
protect the identities of everyone involved, I present a heavily redacted and
abridged version, but the one that keeps the general spirit of it.

It was *incredible* to gain an inside perspective on the workings of
=[company]=. The narrative sometimes leans into personal grudges than being
presented with balanced perspective on the events that occurred. The author
frequently portrays themselves as being on the “right” side of history, which at
times made it feel like they have not gone enough in depth into the
=[company]=. In conclusion, while the book offers some worthwhile observations, I
found myself wanting for a more balanced and introspective approach overall.

Thinking about it, the whole thing presents no strong ideas about anything,
lukewarm all the way through. Nothing specific, no claims, but presented with
an air of authority. Boring flowery language that renders the core message
flat. Emotions as eloquently expressed as meeting would in a conference
room. With a shit sandwich to finish the meal, virtue signaling ``taste.''

Even for the kicks of it, giving it to AI with ``what are your thoughts on
this,'' which it promptly described as (emphasis not mine),

#+begin_quote
No metaphors, no punchy lines, no attitude, no rhythm, no wit. You could swap in
any other reviewer and nothing would change. The review has no
fingerprint. *Effect*: It reads like AI wrote it... even though it's just someone
trying too hard to sound measured.

Lose your character, and the candle stays dark.
