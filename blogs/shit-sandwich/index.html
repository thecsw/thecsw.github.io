You did a fantastic, really, phenomenal job on this. Simply, incredible. This piece though is a hot pile of garbage, it sucks ass, and it stinks. I’m sure it’s no big deal though. I mean, listen, whatever we can get to, it would be amazing.

Great. Thanks. I <strong>love</strong> eating shit sandwiches. Nothing better than getting buttered up, coddled with, given a somewhat real but pent-up with a sprinkle of self-righteousness feedback, immediately followed by a softening of the blow—since, who wants to lose face—and settle on some of the most mediocre compromise possible, because everybody has to be happy. No. Matter. What.

Having lived in a corporate environment—I promise, this is not coming from my current work, but through some other fruitful avenues—you get handed at least one of those every day. The resulting product ends up being total garbage that no side of the bread wants, but everybody is now stuck with it. In the realm of the good ideas on both sides, those who wager wars, always find themselves right in the middle of it, where nobody is happy and the decisions made could not have come from a worse parallel universe that birthed them into existence.

Scrolling through Goodreads one day, I stumbled upon a review from an old acquaintance on a book that I have never heard of, never read, and never planning to. However, the writing and thoughts expressed were so bland that I simply had to say something about it. It irked me in such a way that shaking it off proved to be an annoying exercise of an itself. So, to protect the identities of everyone involved, I present a heavily redacted and abridged version, but the one that keeps the general spirit of it.

It was <strong>incredible</strong> to gain an inside perspective on the workings of <code>[company]</code>. The narrative somitemes leans into personal grudges than being presented with balanced perspective on the events that occurred. The author frequently portrays themselves as being on the “right” side of history, which at times made it feel like they have not gone enough in depth into the <code>[company]</code>. In conclusion, while the book offers some worthwhile observations, I found myself wanting for a more balanced and and introspective approach overall.

Thinking about it, the whole thing presents no strong ideas about anything, lukewarming all the way through. Nothing specific, no claims, but presented with an air of authority. Boring flowery language that renders the core message flat. Emotions as eloquently expressed as meeting would in a conference room. With a shit sandwich to finish the meal, virtue signaling “taste.”

Even for the kicks of it, giving it to AI with “what are your thoughts on this,” which it promptly described as (emphasis not mine),

<div class="paragraph quote" >
<p>
No metaphors, no punchy lines, no attitude, no rhythm, no wit. You could swap in any other reviewer and nothing would change. The review has no fingerprint. <strong>Effect</strong>: It reads like AI wrote it... even though it’s just someone trying too hard to sound measured.
