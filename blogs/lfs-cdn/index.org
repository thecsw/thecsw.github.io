* Git LFS is (not) CDN üçì

I have been using OneDrive as my CDN, where I would mask their big and ugly
embed URLs with my custom-rolled [[https://sandyuraz.com/projects/monokuma/][=monokuma= url shortener]]. What has been
bothering me for a hot moment was the fact that the sources for the website
itself (a bunch of orgmode files) live on github and the rest of ``heavy
content'' lives on OneDrive. What's a better way to marry them than using the
``heavy content'' of git?

It's called [[https://git-lfs.com/][Git Large File Storage]] and to save you some time, this is not story
of a successful pivot to LFS, but a story of how this endeavor was fun to
implement but ultimately failed to become practical. The core reason is pretty
simple---pricing. Follow this string of raw and real discord messages, or not,
but I'm too lazy to write it up and I like the style of unedited discord
messages popping up here on the website.

Im learning about git lfs. It's so money. Because of my big galleries, where
each picture weighs a few MBs, I can't commit them to git, so I moved everything
over to OneDrive, which stores full files and does real-time resizing but then,
finally playing more with LFS, I'm moving everything back into my big 
website repo where all the big files are stored in LFS but tracked through git.
I also wrote a script that automatically creates various sized versions of each
picture are all stored in LFS and tracked through git as well. It's like that
the git file itself just tracks a pointer to the actual object in LFS, but it's
all native.

/... later in the day .../

{{{blush2(7:39pm)}}}
[[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/76a151bc48792811ef0b31f5445297fb318c2213][https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/commit/76a151bc48792811ef0b31f5445297fb318c2213]]

This is what the new LFS galleries/images look like, no even need for me to
maintain a separate url shortener installation all contained in the same
repository, which makes me quite happy. I even wrote a fish script that would
generate different sizes for each picture for me to choose if the target image
is too big, like over 4-5MB some are even 15MBs.

{{{blush2(8:02pm)}}}
The problem with LFS though is that they charge for bandwidth, so $5/mo gets you
50GB/mo, which is nothing.

#+begin_quote
If you push a 500 MB file to Git LFS, you'll use 500 MB of your allotted storage
and none of your bandwidth. If you make a 1 byte change and push the file again,
you'll use another 500 MB of storage and no bandwidth, bringing your total usage
for these two pushes to 1 GB of storage and zero bandwidth.
#+end_quote

So, if you have say a 1GB file, don't you dare make a single-byte
change---you'll kill your entire free storage of 1GB.

#+begin_quote
If you download a 500 MB file that's tracked with LFS, you'll use 500 MB of the
repository owner's allotted bandwidth. If a collaborator pushes a change to the
file and you pull the new version to your local repository, you'll use another
500 MB of bandwidth, bringing the total usage for these two downloads to 1 GB of
bandwidth.
#+end_quote

Hmmmmm. I might not fully pivot to LFS yet, it seems to be hella expensive. If I
have 50GB of bandwidth rn and say I have 10 1MB files, then you can kill my
bandwidth by loading the website 5,000 times or if 5,000 users open the website,
which is nothing.

{{{blush2(8:11pm)}}}
How hard is it to serve a picture? Azure does $0.081/GB/mo
[[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cdn/][https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cdn/]].

{{{blush2(8:40pm)}}}
I know for a fact that I'm not using this bandwidth.

#+html_tags: style="width:47rem";
[[7gb_used.webp][7.35GB of the bandwidth used up in the first hour.]]

So some bots and crawlers are killing my lfs allowance I'm already paying
for. Project probably folded, this is literally only like 5/200 images. In the
last 3 minutes, it went up by another 500MB. This is wonderful. I wonder how
quickly I'll reach the 50GB on random pages I onboarded to LFS.

{{{blush2(8:56pm)}}}
Something is aggressively crawling my website.

#+html_tags: style="width:47rem";
[[almost10gb_used.webp][Another 2GB of bandwidth gone in just 16 minutes.]]

The usage is going up crazy, like 1GB every 10 minutes.

{{{jame2(8:57pm)}}}
maybe something related to index now?

{{{blush2(8:58pm)}}}
All pages that turned to LFS only serve maybe ~10MB each and indexnow will
probably get with a delay, the fact it's rising aggressively means there is
something else.

{{{jame2(8:59pm)}}}
hmmmmmm interesting

{{{blush2(8:59pm)}}}
Yeah, I wonder if I run out of the 50GBs tomorrow morning when I wake up.

{{{jame2(8:59pm)}}}
So the LFS allowance is like total bandwidth?

{{{blush2(8:59pm)}}}
Yeah; Onedrive at least gives me unlimited bandwidth lol.

{{{jame2(9:00pm)}}}
So you only get 50GB of total data transfers per month? Both serve and commit?

{{{blush2(9:00pm)}}}
Serve only, commit/uploads don't count towards that.

{{{jame2(9:00pm)}}}
Ahhh; I see, I see. Interesting; Yeah that is kind of a rip as a cdn---esp since
azure is so cheap.

{{{blush2(9:00pm)}}}
Azure is actually same price. Cheapest is $0.08/GB/mo, so 50GB is $4.00/mo. Not
too far from $5/mo.

{{{jame2(9:01pm)}}}
Abhhhh; I miscalculated.

{{{blush2(9:02pm)}}}
The most expensive option in zone 3 is $0.2/GB/mo, so it's a whopping $10/mo for
50GB/mo.

{{{jame2(9:02pm)}}}
What makes zone 3 so good?

{{{blush2(9:02pm)}}}
- Zone 1‚ÄîNorth America, Europe, Middle East and Africa
- Zone 2‚ÄîAsia Pacific (including Japan)
- Zone 3‚ÄîSouth America
- Zone 4‚ÄîAustralia
- Zone 5‚ÄîIndia
  
Just regions have different prices, probably based on availabilities.

{{{jame2(9:08pm)}}}
That makes sense. I see, I see. What about just use compressed images on the
site and then link to the full res hosted somewhere else like google photos or
some other service that just hosts the photos as files that way you save on cdn
costs?

{{{blush2(9:10pm)}}}
Already doing it.

{{{jame2(9:10pm)}}}
lol nice

{{{blush2(9:10pm)}}}
Even then it's already getting out of hand. I suppose I'm just not a fan of
bandwidth billing, I'd much rather pay for costs only because it can get out of
control real quick. The user doesn't pay to retrieve your pictures but you pay
every time serving them.

{{{jame2(9:11pm)}}}
Yeah that‚Äôs tough.

{{{blush2(9:11pm)}}}
So, for CDN, I recommend OneDrive. You pay for storage and you just get a
sharing embed HTML link no questions asked.

{{{ephin2(9:16pm)}}}
Its time I tell you Ive been aggressively refreshing your website for 3 hours.

{{{blush2(9:17pm)}}}
lmaooooo \
Noooooooo

{{{blush2(9:30pm)}}}
Pls stop refreshing. It's already past 10GB. There are only like 3 pages that
have LFS. I haven't done another 50!

{{{ephin2(9:30pm)}}}
But I gotta see every single change.

{{{blush2(9:31pm)}}}
I'll have to revert those tomorrow.

{{{blush2(9:31pm)}}}
lol


I guess I could switch to gitea [[https://about.gitea.com/pricing/][https://about.gitea.com/pricing/]] and gitlab,
which don't talk about bandwidth in their LFS, but I'm also pretty set on using
github, since it's already hosting the website itself.

It would be kinda cringe to have the same repo across git services and serve
different files from a different service and paying for all of them.

After I have already repointed everything away from LFS back onto OneDrive,
fronted by my URL shortener---5 days later, I got an email that my usage is
/somehow/ near limit. Checking on it, I'm 94.76% at capacity for my bandwidth,
days after I stopped using LFS completely (staggering ~70% jump). Where does the
usage come from? Beats me. Github does not provide any sort of analytics that
could tell me whether this came from direct LFS pulls, through media, forks,
other? What a shame.

{{{ephin2(5 days later)}}}
Github found a free momey glitch where if they just use up your bandwidth
themselves they can charge you

never use LFS\

#+begin_quote
After you remove files from Git LFS, the Git LFS objects still exist on the
remote storage and will continue to count toward your Git LFS storage quota.

To remove Git LFS objects from a repository, delete and recreate the
repository. When you delete a repository, any associated issues, stars, and
forks are also deleted.
#+end_quote

You can never remove LFS objects from remote, which continue counting towards
your bill, unless you delete the repository and recreate it---so I have to drop
my github pages repo and recreate it.

[[ticket.webp][Opening a ticket with Github to get the LFS objects pruned.]]

I'm creating a ticket for github to remove LFS objects without dropping the repo
and copilot interjected as a way to stop me from opening a ticket only to say,

#+begin_quote
GitHub does not currently provide a self-service method to purge Git LFS objects
from the remote storage without deleting and recreating the repository. *However,
since you want to retain your repository and its history while removing all LFS
objects, you will need to contact GitHub Support directly for assistance.*
#+end_quote

I know!!! That's why I'm opening it manually.

#+html_tags: style="width:37rem";
[[copilot.webp][Copilot, you are not being helpful!]]

A few hours later, I was free from the dangling LFS objects.
