* Faster, better, stronger neomutt 🐩

November 27th, 2019

** Abstract
Hello there! This is an article on advanced neomutt features that might have
been missed in my [[../using_mutt][previous article]] on (neo)mutt. This page has been inspired by
[[https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/1958][some of the issues]] I had with neomutt and the fantastic neomutt community. 

** Named Mailboxes
With release [[https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/20191102][20191102]], neomutt team has introduced named-mailboxes features,
which allows you to name your mailboxes (duh) in the sidebar. It can be used for
some pretty creative things, like setting a mailbox different to what you have
in your `.mail` directory, change the language, or make delimeters. For example,
here is an excerpt from one of my neomutt accounts that is tied to my KU mail
account

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
set folder="~/.mail/kumail"
set spoolfile = +'INBOX'

set trash = +'Deleted Items'
set postponed = +'Drafts'
set record = +'Sent Items'
named-mailboxes "  ―――――― ♠ KU ――――――  " =Journal
named-mailboxes "↓ Inbox" =INBOX
named-mailboxes "↑ Sent" ='Sent Items'
named-mailboxes "∇ Trash" ='Deleted Items'
named-mailboxes "∗ Junk" ='Junk Email'
named-mailboxes "∃ Drafts" ='Drafts'
#+END_EXAMPLE

After launching neomutt, it gives me nice custom sidebar with a dope delimeter

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 ―――――― ♠ KU ――――――   │ 1 |   [11-27-19 12:03:35] Mom       Did you buy eggs?
↓ Inbox [32]       3568│ 2 |   [11-27-19 09:07:01] Bill      All rights reserved.
↑ Sent              797│ 3 |   [11-27-19 06:07:02] Lao Tse   Difficult Paths
∇ Trash             359│ 4 |   [11-27-19 06:59:18] Mando     This is the way
∗ Junk                4│ 5 |   [11-26-19 22:59:02] BlondiXXX How much does she love you?
∃ Drafts               │ 6 |   ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

`named-mailboxes` also work with multiple accounts. You can use some garbage
mailboxes (looking at you, Journal) as delimeters. 

** Threads
I have been looking around how to do threads and I finally found out
how. Usually, mutt just gives you your mail all in one blob of a list. With
threads, you can have beautiful trees of replies, threads, forwards, and more!
To trigger that, just add this to your `.muttrc`

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
set sort = 'reverse-threads'
set sort_aux = 'last-date-received'
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is how it looks with huge mail chains

For ease of use, you can add the following line to bind your `c` key to collapse
threads 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
macro index c <collapse-thread> "collapse-thread"
#+END_EXAMPLE
