* Prettifying org-mode with CSS ðŸ’…

May 9th, 2020

Org Mode HTML output can look like [[https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/][this webpage]], but as its [[http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/][big brother]]
rightfully states, a /grotesque pile of shit/. Same goes for orgmode. I wrote a
very small CSS file that you can add to your orgmode header and the output
should smoother

You can just add this line here or just use the bare CSS as a starting point to
make your own (everyone has their own style):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+html_head: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sandyuraz.com/styles/org.css">
#+END_SRC

Even a really little makeup can make a big difference! There is a good
discussion about this article on [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23130104][hackernews]]! 

NOTE: Please do not rely solely on the link above, this post is merely a demo of
how you can control your org html output. I update that org.css quite frequently.
