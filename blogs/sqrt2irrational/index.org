** Abstract
It's been a while since I wanted to install some math packages on my
website. Finally, I managed to do it by getting =asciidoctor-latex= and
running some quick =Makefile= magic. It looks like it's working fine! Here is a
simple proof that I've come to like over the years.

THEOREM
   
$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
   
PROOF
   
Let $a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \quad, \frac{a}{b}=\sqrt{2},\quad b \neq 0, \quad (a,b)=1$

Then $a=\sqrt{2}b$
   
$\implies a^2=2 \times b^2 \quad (\Xi)$
   
$\implies 2|a^2$
   
$\implies 2|a$
   
Then if $a$ is even, $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ni a = 2k$
   
Then substitute into $(\Xi)$, we get $(2 \times k)^2=2\times b^2$
   
$\implies 4 \times k^2 = 2 \times b^2$
   
$\implies 2 \times k^2 = b^2$
   
$\implies 2|b^2$
   
$\implies 2|b$

If $a$ and $b$ are both even, it contradicts the initial condition $(a,b)=1$.
   
$\therefore$ By Law of Contradiction, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
