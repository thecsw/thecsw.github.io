* Library I Want to Live In ðŸ“š
I built this over the course of two days and it had taken me more time than I
have ever originally anticipated for it to take. In part, since it requires
every single book to be individually wrapped---this set is a great teacher in
patience that I might be just that much more of a holier man myself.

Even though it is such a clichÃ© thing to say so---but I wish to live and breathe
in a library, in a space, if not /just/ like this, but the /vibes/ *must* be the
same. I could describe it even akin to Ghibli or cottage witch repertoire. Feel
free to pinch in to zoom in.

Makes me want to build more of these. In the nights after work when the dinner
is ready, I realized to have this warm obsession with watching youtube videos of
small Japanese businesses, where the owners, may they be retirees running a
bakery or an ex-caregiver running an Okonomiyaki shop---they are all dedicated
to their craft---giving their all; putting themselves into the smallest minute
details. I'm always sitting in admiration and inspired to live consciously.
