June 5th, 2020

The insta story

With my new [insta](https://www.instagram.com/sandy_uraz/), I decided to
do my first song challenge where I have to put a new song every day,
which matches that day\'s description. Here we go!

Also, here is the [original story
reel](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17848385216106957/).
