<p>
As more time passed since I first read <em>Brothers Karamazov</em> (BK) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, I realized more clearly how profoundly this novel impacted me. Without all the exaggeration and even excluding the flowery language – I consider myself to be, if not radically, but consciously different people before and after my journey with BK.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
If we were talking and through some avenue of thoughts, we get myself to get started on it; I won’t stop talking for many hours if you let me. Instead of endlessly holding people hostage listening to me going on the brilliance of Dostoevsky and the intricacies of his <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>, I thought I would put my thoughts down here. Not exactly ink on paper, but something nonetheless.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
<em>Brothers Karamazov</em> is a profoundly religious work. Imagine all the literature world has ever written, crossing borders, races, and cultures. If I see it as a big pile of everything together, BK stands there utterly alone from the group. In all my arrogance, I would proclaim that nothing close to it has ever been written – it is in a whole league of its own, which makes it unfair for any other work to be compared to <em>Brothers Karamazov</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
After finishing the book in over three weeks (the most turbulent and longest three weeks of my life for many other reasons), I found peace within myself. Somehow, many things that bothered and burned me from the inside about relationships and worries discovered a way to resolve themselves. Not that I forgot about them or consciously ignored the issues, but the brain rewired itself to deal with regular pleasantries and unpleasantries of life in a new way.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
<em>Brothers Karamazov</em> made me love God again. The brothers helped to find forgiveness in me for other people and situations. Most importantly, forgiveness for myself. I remember this distinct feeling after finishing the book – “I will never read anything better than this.” Of course, <em>never say never</em>; however, this one is <em>my</em> exception. This thought didn’t trouble me either. I was happy to know I reached this kind of literature and experienced it while alive.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
It does not mean that I won’t enjoy any other literature I come across in the future or snarkily compare everything to BK – no, no. <strong>That</strong> would defeat the purpose of acquiring a taste for high literature. I will still enjoy reading any other book and still do; I will critique and review anything I read by the baseline that I feel is proper; however, deep down, I know that my limit has been reached. Similarly, I know that I would never be able to write like Dostoevsky. Even if I am ever as good as the smallest and tiniest sliver of his early writings – that part of me can retire fulfilled. <b style="color:var(--color-tomb)">◼︎</b>
