* Rebecca SUPREMACY üç¨

147; 12023 H.E.

Yoinked and twisted directly from a wall of text I sent to my friends in our
discord server. Totally unsolicited and no one asked for it. My take on Rebecca
and Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners.

-----

I've been thinking of what I mentioned about Lucy\
I realized why I /probably/ wouldn't want to be with someone like her\

but yeah\
I dated girls like Lucy and in emotional connection/relationships as well\
The biggest drawback there is they are very hard to read and the hardest part\
they usually never voice out their feelings or how they see the relationship\
so a lot of little things that get under your/their skin build up over time\
you might be doing something purely and out of your heart\
but it might be driving them crazy or make them build those annoyances up\
however, the most tragic thing in all of this, is that you don't know that\
and whenever they *do* bring it up in the relationship, the things have
deteriorated far enough past the breaking point\ 
so it's not a preventative measure of understanding what ticks either person\
but a full-blown big incident or a scandal that has thousands of layers of
resentment and such\

whenever a relationship gets to that stage, the chances of it staying healthy
long-term are practically nil\
because it got to that stage, even if you talk it through (when it got too big)\
little seeds of resentments and everything might still be left over\
that will grow into a very big tree that might not be able to be cut down later
down the road\
those relationships and a habit of staying open in health and sickness doesn't
come after one big argument\
it takes years and maybe even a life's worth amount of active and grueling work
to practice daily\

so before the people in the example learn how to keep it healthy and open\
another big conflict and an explosion of negativity might have already exploded\
and this time, blew up the connection and the relationship completely\
I think it's usually because people aren't used to discuss relationships, this
happen\
in any normal relationship, whenever someone expresses their feelings to you\
``I felt hurt when you said/did X,'' we're used to it as a very big red flag\

that things have gotten really bad and immediately tense up\
this can involve a lot of scar tissue from million other small little things
already being built up\
so having that vulnerability and openness about expressing your feelings\
``but don't worry, it's not a sign of anything bad, things are fine, but I want
to share my feelings with you to prevent any kind of resentment or annoyance
from building up'' takes a lot of work\
of course, it is a nuanced topic, you shouldn't also express your every single
little frustration in hopes of ``I can fix him'' or ``I can fix her''\
it's more of a proactive work on constantly being able to come to a compromise
about each other's feelings\

this is all my and only my isolated perspective on Lucy, without a goal of
influencing anyone for or against Lucy

but yeah, just to close up and make a nice bow tie\ 
Lucy is great, but been in relationships with many ``archetypes'' of her\ 
the difficulty of reading a person and even if I try to stay proactive in
expressing feelings, but making it very clear that ``it is not because things are
bad, completely the opposite, actually'' can make people tense up or get them
freaked out by it (completely understandable though, we as a society aren't
taught or told that it's okay to say how you feel *no matter what the situation
or state of affairs is*)\

I like Rebecca because she wears her feelings a bit more on her sleeve and she
can show you where she stands on topics/issues rather sooner than later (and she
will let you know)\ 
whereas Lucy-kind will tell you when it's too late to fix anything (even if you
tried your best)\ 
like, when Rebecca's brother was killed, Rebecca disappeared for a couple of
episodes or some time\ 
I remember that and when she came back, she was back to her ``usual'' self and
back upbeat\ 
which showed how deep it shook her, but she knows how to get herself out of the
funk\ 
while also giving herself enough time and space to grieve and live through
emotions\

to me that showed *fantastic* emotional balance and maturity of Rebecca\ 
things aren't going to be easy with her for sure though\ 
she's a force to be reckoned with in and out, however, by staying in sync\ 
which Rebecca would welcome and work towards both of you to do\ 
the chances of building and having a healthy long-term relationship with her are
much much higher\ 
and she's hella fun\

Rebecca truly loved David, yet instead of holding it in or having a sense of
animosity \ 
she had that big bestie vibe that no matter if they aren't together\
doesn't stop them being edgerunners together\
again, shows the loyalty and *excellent* way Rebecca deals with emotions\

lots to learn from her\
that is why Rebecca is my religion\

so basically yeah, I say no to Lucy (sold out David in the beginning) and full
yes to Rebecca (never betrayed, OG member since the beginning)
