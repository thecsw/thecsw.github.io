* My Spotify Wrapped for 2022 👩‍🎤

338; 12022 H.E.

Well, well, well, here we are again! [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped/][/Almost a year later./]] World goes round,
chaos happens, but we all patiently await for when Spotify drops [[https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/][new Wrapped]].
To get sentimental just for one fleeting moment -- this was a tough year with
its many downs and thankfully, many more ups. Let us see what music got us
through those trying times!

First and foremost, I found out that my top genres this year were: /Anime/,
/Japanese VGM/ (ahh, /Persona/!), /Otacore/, /J-Rock/, and /J-Pop/. Logically, my number
one song and artist that I listened the living vibes out of were of course
/Beneath the Mask/ and /Lyn/, respectively.

This paints a very particular picture about a person. All I do >95% of the time
is listen to my custom playlist, [[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6P7ksZ5uGpVp4qq9gDhFlj?si=60febde8005a4e8f][/amelia/]].

On a similar note, if we collect it a bit more, my top songs also include: /One
Last Kiss/ (I absolutely *love* Eva 3+1), /Deal with the devil/ (well, what can I say
-- *I am a gambling man*), /D City Rock/ (/PSG/ would never let you down), and finally,
/Beautiful Day/ ([[https://sandyuraz.com/anime/banished/][a great callback]]).

On the artists side of things, it looks a bit funny, but the first two are all
Persona 5, followed by /Eir Aoi/ (who dominates [[https://sandyuraz.com/anime/sao/][SAO]] openings), then the brilliant
/DECO*27/ (who for me, reinvented Hatsune Miku with the [[https://youtu.be/-H2PCK7DJsQ][best cup noodles
commercial]]), finally, closing in with /TeddyLoid/ (everything [[https://open.spotify.com/album/1OcPnTk7T4fgB8nkl4AOh6?si=B24XpcO1QIaR0k-6JfBklw][/PSG]]/, [[https://open.spotify.com/track/4MxL1VijbxrUGBu39TgzMY?si=db6a18f8bf4744d6][/Pipo
Password/]], and [[https://open.spotify.com/track/3JkwzHI9Oe3TVl2sYhOHQP?si=5ba5f6e1b90c4485][other classics]]).

All of this amounted to *whopping* 22,121 minutes of active minutes listened! This
is just shy of 369 hours (/nice/) and a bit more than 15 days. I like the fact
that I spent around 4% of the year listening to Spotify (many more songs were on
other platforms as well or /other means/).

Last but not least, I like that Spotify creates a "personality" profile for you
based on everything it has just shown you. If I look at what it gave me above,
it looks like this person /maybe likes anime/. Unclear.

Withouth further adieu -- those are pretty self-explanatory. Please find the top
selection of this Wrapped below! /Until next time./
