This is just a showcase of my building process of my new best friend -
https://myminijenni.weebly.com/[Mini Jenni], made by Jenny Cox. Before
the pictures start pouring in, I want to say that this is not an
advertisement, I do not personally know Jenny Cox, and I am not being
paid in any way for endorsing the figure.

I just liked it.
