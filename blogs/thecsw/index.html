🍙 At least 3 years, 5 months, and 17 days ago
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Many have asked me about my tag <em>thecsw</em> that I have used for the past ten-ish years. I thought it would be nice to write up a quick summary of how it came to be, as it had many iterations and some arbitrary changes made to it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
First of all, it <strong>does not</strong> stand for <em>The Computer Science Wizard</em>, though it would be kinda cool if it did. Super corny and cheesy, just the way I like it. However, that’s something created after the fact.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I was in 7th grade, it was time to become a true gamer. What does a true gamer need? A nickname to go by. Especially in Minecraft multiplayer lobbies. My first one was <em>MrSagindyk</em>, which blows. Let’s think about this. What would be a good nickname? Ah yes,
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph center" >
<p>
<em><strong>CoolSmoothy</strong></em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
It’s perfect. I like smoothies, using a <em>y</em> instead of <em>ie</em> makes it look gangster and very new-blood tech. I’m also cool 😎 But wait! Not only am I cool, but I’m also <strong>the coolest</strong> one. Therefore, the only appropriate nickname for me is
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph center" >
<p>
<em><strong>TheCoolSmoothy</strong></em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
It’s perfect (x2). Time to set it everywhere, especially on my trusty Xbox 360 my parents got me for Christmas.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
<em>probably a couple of weeks later...</em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Dude, this blows. I forgot my password to my xbox account. It had my cool nickname, <em>TheCoolSmoothy</em>. I still want to use it but can’t restore my password. No worries, I’ll just create a new account with the same username. Oh wait, I can’t. All right, modify it a little bit but still make it look somehow cool, maybe mysterious...
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph center" >
<p>
<em><strong>TheCoolSmoothyW</strong></em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I’m a <strong>genius</strong>. That <em>W</em> really brings it together. Doesn’t mean anything. At least I have a new xbox account now. Speaking of new accounts, I saw a cool poop emoji-shaped pillow on eBay; I kinda want it. Gotta make an ebay account with my username. Holdup, does it have a character limit? Hmmm
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph center" >
<p>
<em><strong>tcsw</strong></em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
It’s perfect (x3). I’ve been going by <em>tcsw</em> for many months after that. I think that was around the time I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network" title="">The Social Network</a> by Aaron Sorkin. Remember that scene with Sean Parker, where he tells Mark to drop the “the”?
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="media" >
<a class="image" ><img class="image" src="the.webp" title="Drop the ``The'', just ``Facebook''. It's cleaner" alt="Drop the ``The'', just ``Facebook''. It's cleaner"></a>
<div class="title">Drop the “The”, just “Facebook”. It’s cleaner</div>
<hr>
</div><div class="writing">

<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Well, I decided to do the exact opposite. Bring the “the” back, whole <em>thecsw</em>. It’s crispier. And there we have it,
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph center" >
<p>
<em><strong>thecsw</strong></em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
It’s perfect (x4). This tag I made up when I was 13 has stuck with me ever since. I have some pretty rivals that are too similar to my tag, such as: <em>Commission on the Status of Women</em>, <em>The CW Network,</em> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theCSW/status/10294886446" title="">ChristianSingleWoman</a> (actually squatted @thecsw on Twitter).
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Here is to <em>thecsw</em> propelling forward and drilling through the Heavens! <b style="color:var(--color-tomb)">◼︎</b>
