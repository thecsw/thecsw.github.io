* The evolution of /thecsw/ ðŸ§‹

96; 12022 H.E.

Many have asked me about my tag /thecsw/ that I have used for the past ten-ish
years. I thought it would be nice to write up a quick summary of how it came to
be, as it had many iterations and some arbitrary changes made to it.

First of all, it *does not* stand for /The Computer Science Wizard/, though it would
be kinda cool if it did. Super corny and cheesy, just the way I like
it. However, that's something created after the fact.

I was in 7th grade, it was time to become a true gamer. What does a true gamer
need? A nickname to go by. Especially in Minecraft multiplayer lobbies. My first
one was /MrSagindyk/, which blows. Let's think about this. What would be a good
nickname? Ah yes,

#+begin_center
*/CoolSmoothy/*
#+end_center

It's perfect. I like smoothies, using a /y/ instead of /ie/ makes it look gangster
and very new-blood tech. I'm also cool ðŸ˜Ž But wait! Not only am I cool, but I'm
also *the coolest* one. Therefore, the only appropriate nickname for me is

#+begin_center
*/TheCoolSmoothy/*
#+end_center

It's perfect (x2). Time to set it everywhere, especially on my trusty Xbox 360
my parents got me for Christmas.

/probably a couple of weeks later.../

Dude, this blows. I forgot my password to my xbox account. It had my cool
nickname, /TheCoolSmoothy/. I still want to use it but can't restore my
password. No worries, I'll just create a new account with the same username. Oh
wait, I can't. All right, modify it a little bit but still make it look somehow
cool, maybe mysterious...

#+begin_center
*/TheCoolSmoothyW/*
#+end_center

I'm a *genius*. That /W/ really brings it together. Doesn't mean anything. At
least I have a new xbox account now. Speaking of new accounts, I saw a cool poop
emoji-shaped pillow on eBay; I kinda want it. Gotta make an ebay
account with my username. Holdup, does it have a character limit?
Hmmm

#+begin_center
*/tcsw/*
#+end_center

It's perfect (x3). I've been going by /tcsw/ for many months after that. I think
that was around the time I watched [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network][The Social Network]] by Aaron Sorkin. Remember
that scene with Sean Parker, where he tells Mark to drop the ``the''?

[[the.webp][Drop the ``The'', just ``Facebook''. It's cleaner]]

Well, I decided to do the exact opposite. Bring the ``the'' back, whole
/thecsw/. It's crispier. And there we have it,

#+begin_center
*/thecsw/*
#+end_center

It's perfect (x4). This tag I made up when I was 13 has stuck with me ever
since. I have some pretty rivals that are too similar to my tag, such as:
/Commission on the Status of Women/, /The CW Network,/ and [[https://twitter.com/theCSW/status/10294886446][ChristianSingleWoman]]
(actually squatted @thecsw on Twitter).

Here is to /thecsw/ propelling forward and drilling through the Heavens!
