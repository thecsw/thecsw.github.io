* My Spotify Wrapped for 2024 ðŸ‘§

343; 12024 H.E.

We have seen each other in [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped/][2021]], [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-2/][2022]], [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-3/][2023]], and now it is finally the turn for
2024 to come out and shine. I realized how lazy I have been lately because the
last time I published something in the ``random'' section of the blog was almost
a year ago, to the exact day. With /Wrapped 2024/ getting released, the thought of
breaking the mold and giving life to this blog section had excited me but only
for a moment or so. Unfortunately, I think the summary and ``fun analysis'' of
year's worth of music tastes were kind of underwhelming. You will see why soon.

So, to start off, let's cover what they gave as the ``seasonal listens.'' In
January, if I recall, [[https://steamdeckhq.com/news/valve-rockstar-fix-gta-online-steam-deck/][before GTA Online became unplayable on Steam Deck]], I would
play the game after work and the constant blast of Non-Stop-FM with fantastic
Cara Delevingne right into my ears through headphones made crave for more of the
all-time pop classics and modern pieces circa early 2000s. September was marked
off with anime---business as usual--immediately followed by a month of classical
music in October---[[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/anime/][business as usual]].

Surprisingly enough, this is already half of all what the /Wrapped/ had this year!
I tried to save as much as I could for the dessert. So. This
year. I. Have. Finally. Made. It. Into. *0.001%* of /anything/ on Spotify! /Girl/ by
/Men I Trust/ is such a soothing song that I kept listening to it on repeat while
at work and any other times when I felt like it. Their entire collection is
straight quality, which somehow made me make it into their top 1% of worldwide
listeners. And they are a massively popular band, so not even 10 hours is enough
to break into that special little club? Heh.

Last but not least, of course---our honorable mentions. Compared to the last
year's /Wrapped 2023/, four out of five songs kept their lead! I am simply
addicted to /Vitality/ (can never go wrong with anything /Helltaker/-related),
/Absolute Territory/ (omg, it's like a hard drug), /Girl/ (of course), and
/NIGHT RUNNING/ (even though I haven't touched the show since finishing it, the
soundtrack slaps). It was only /odoriko/ that traded places with /Blues In Velvet
Room/, which makes sense, since I always tend to retreat to my comfort zone of
Persona and ATLUS music. Maybe when the new /Chainsaw Man/ movie is out, I can get
back into Vaundy back yet again.

I suppose I have forgotten to give honorable mentions to top artists. Big thanks
to my friend Jake for recommending a progressive Japanese jazz band from the
70s, /CASIOPEA/---highly recommend if you've never heard of them before. /Low Roar/
is an easy choice---ever since that /Death Stranding/ trailer, it had an
unreasonably large influence on my taste in music. Last but not least, /Daft
Punk/! Should I even say anything? I shed a tear when they parted ways, but it
made sense. They have truly reached the heights and mastery of their craft that
none have grasped or understood before nor after.

Thanks for joining my on my /Wrapped/ journey once again. Fourth year and
counting. Hopefully, here is to many more in the future. /Adieu!/
