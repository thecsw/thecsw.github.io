🥥 At least 9 months and 29 days ago

<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
We have seen each other in <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped/" title="">2021</a>, <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-2/" title="">2022</a>, <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/wrapped-3/" title="">2023</a>, and now it is finally the turn for 2024 to come out and shine. I realized how lazy I have been lately because the last time I published something in the “random” section of the blog was almost a year ago, to the exact day. With <em>Wrapped 2024</em> getting released, the thought of breaking the mold and giving life to this blog section had excited me but only for a moment or so. Unfortunately, I think the summary and “fun analysis’&#39; of year’s worth of music tastes were kind of underwhelming. You will see why soon.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
So, to start off, let’s cover what they gave as the “seasonal listens.” In January, if I recall, <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/valve-rockstar-fix-gta-online-steam-deck/" title="">before GTA Online became unplayable on Steam Deck</a>, I would play the game after work and the constant blast of Non-Stop-FM with fantastic Cara Delevingne right into my ears through headphones made crave for more of the all-time pop classics and modern pieces circa early 2000s. September was marked off with anime—business as usual–immediately followed by a month of classical music in October—<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/anime/" title="">business as usual</a>.

Surprisingly enough, this is already half of all what the <em>Wrapped</em> had this year! I tried to save as much as I could for the dessert. So. This year. I. Have. Finally. Made. It. Into. <strong>0.001%</strong> of <em>anything</em> on Spotify! <em>Girl</em> by <em>Men I Trust</em> is such a soothing song that I kept listening to it on repeat while at work and any other times when I felt like it. Their entire collection is straight quality, which somehow made me make it into their top 1% of worldwide listeners. And they are a massively popular band, so not even 10 hours is enough to break into that special little club? Heh.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Last but not least, of course—our honorable mentions. Compared to the last year’s <em>Wrapped 2023</em>, four out of five songs kept their lead! I am simply addicted to <em>Vitality</em> (can never go wrong with anything <em>Helltaker</em>-related), <em>Absolute Territory</em> (omg, it’s like a hard drug), <em>Girl</em> (of course), and <em>NIGHT RUNNING</em> (even though I haven’t touched the show since finishing it, the soundtrack slaps). It was only <em>odoriko</em> that traded places with <em>Blues In Velvet Room</em>, which makes sense, since I always tend to retreat to my comfort zone of Persona and ATLUS music. Maybe when the new <em>Chainsaw Man</em> movie is out, I can get back into Vaundy back yet again.

I suppose I have forgotten to give honorable mentions to top artists. Big thanks to my friend Jake for recommending a progressive Japanese jazz band from the 70s, <em>CASIOPEA</em>—highly recommend if you’ve never heard of them before. <em>Low Roar</em> is an easy choice—ever since that <em>Death Stranding</em> trailer, it had an unreasonably large influence on my taste in music. Last but not least, <em>Daft Punk</em>! Should I even say anything? I shed a tear when they parted ways, but it made sense. They have truly reached the heights and mastery of their craft that none have grasped or understood before nor after.

I made a separate immutable spotify playlist with top 100 songs of the year, hopefully the embed keeps on living here for a while.

Thanks for joining my on my <em>Wrapped</em> journey once again. Fourth year and counting. Hopefully, here is to many more in the future. <em>Adieu!</em> <b style="color:var(--color-tomb)">◼︎</b>
