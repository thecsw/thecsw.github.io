* My Spotify Wrapped for 2023 ðŸ—¼

Hello there! [[../wrapped][Again]] and [[../wrapped-2][again]]. I'm happy you're here with me on the third year of
sharing my embarassing taste in music. I am *not* like the other girls.

We'll start with the general stats. I must say, I *have* been on a steady rise in
terms of my minutes. In 2021, I listened to 11,183 minutes (â‰ˆ186 hours); in
2022, I listened to 22,121 minutes (â‰ˆ369 hours, *nice*). Apparently, this year I
listened to a whopping 31,645 minutes worth of spotify music this year. That
adds up to *strong 527 hours*. ðŸ¦«.

And well of course, repeating the tradition of 2021, /Vitality/ made it to my top
chart, yet again. Something about [[https://sandyuraz.com/plastic/lucifer/][helltaker]]... The rest of my top five songs
describe me pretty well. When I'm at work, I would queue one of them on repeat
from morning till evening, just on loop and non-stop. Psycho behavior. I
know. They are so good, though.

I must say---I'm proud this year as I have finally made it into the 1%. Only in
the context of spotify wrapped, though. And this was the most surprising
revelation to me---I somehow made it into /Pillows'/ top percent of listeners. But
they are such an iconic group, there totally have to be a lot more /Pillows/ heads
out there than me. But oh well---it is backed up *math*, so I'll trust it. This
year, they also showed the top town and place in the world that resembles your
taste---unsurprisingly enough, /Tokyo/.

Or maybe the top artists breakdown by months? January was a good month, though I
could not tell you what I was up to then...

Let's finish it up with some honorable mentions, which is summarizing my
type---of who I am; that's pretty straightforward. I'm a big binge listener on
repeat that is somehow always focused around anime-adjacent song genres. Welp,
that's enough of me!\
See you later ðŸ«¦ (non-seducing)
