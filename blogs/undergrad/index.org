* My undergraduate career ðŸ§º

14; 12022 H.E.

Being a senior in college is weird. I have to confess that I contracted
senioritis big time. So much has changed since my first time coming to the
University of Kansas. The change was very well expected, actually desired. But
what I failed to predict was the number of things that not only will change but
completely go away. Don't forget about this whole pandemic situation that
happened right in the middle, kind of pushing me off the grid.  

With everything that happened and in my current state, I wanted to document my
undergraduate career, while I still remember it and have the energy and passion
to write about. This post is a retrospection into every single semester and
every single course I have taken. I remember everything. To keep it focused,
this essay will only concentrate on academic life, which is a smaller part of
all my time, yet an important one as well. *CHARGE!*  

** Fall 2018 

Welcome, everyone! My first semester at KU and university life in general. I was
a starry-eyed young incoming computer science freshman. All I recall from the
very beginning are emotions of excitement and curiosity. As the first time
living away from my parents and family, I'm surprised how well I did. I haven't
gotten homesick for the first two years in college. Making your bed? Going to
the laundry? Figuring out food? Spending however much time you want with your
friends? My friend, I loved it! The freedom of acting on my own and living
through their consequences is something I have desired for so long.  

As an incoming freshman, we all had to talk to our advisors and get our first
semester courses all scheduled up. I was very fortunate to be admitted into the
Honors department at KU, which had the best advisory board in the entire
institution. I got my classic freshman-level humanities classes, first
programming class (even though I wasn't new to coding, I had to take it), and a
movie class! Thanks to Ed Healy for changing some random art history class on
the other side of the campus for what turned out to be one of my favorite
classes.  

*** Programming I, Honors 

The first programming course in our department is denoted as EECS 168. There is
an Honors version that I took, which is just EECS 169. Have to say, there is not
much difference between the two. Same lectures, same labs, and same exams. The
only thing that sets it apart is an additional problem Honors students have to
do with every homework/lab. Ironically enough, this doesn't sound bad at all,
but that single additional problem tended to be more difficult than all of the
other problems combined.  

The course was primarily taught in C++. This was the God-chosen language in our
department. We all start by learning how to turn on a computer (this is a
jape). This course is more oriented for people that have never done any computer
programming before. You would learn the fundamentals, such as for-loops,
if-statements, functions, switches, pointers, dynamic memory, and classes. I
have done [[https://sandyuraz.com/projects/memeinvestor_bot/][some]] [[https://sandyuraz.com/projects/collatz/][projects]] [[https://sandyuraz.com/projects/prequelmemes_bot/][before]], so all of the material taught wasn't new.  

There is no way you can test out of this course. The department is pretty
adamant about you taking this course, even if you had plenty of exposure to
higher-level programming. I remember this was the first time I would skip
classes, forget when midterms are, and just show up late. The hubris was
building up. I met most of my closest friends now in that class, as we would
work together on labs and just hang out. All in all, an amazing class taught by
[[https://eecs.ku.edu/john-gibbons][John Gibbons]]. He was the best choice for intro CS courses.  

*** Honors Introduction to English 

Everyone has to do what's called the KU Core. Long story short, it's a set of
courses that every single student at KU has to take. Just the general education
everyone has to go through. I think it is a really good way to promote your
student to be more well-rounded individuals. As a part of the KU Core, every
student has to take ENGL 102, which is your basic old English class. Somehow, I
haven't been able to test out of it with my IB score, so I got enrolled in it.  

On the first day of classes, I show up and we start doing introductions. Dude, I
didn't like the professor and the vibe of the class the literal moment I walked
into that sad basement classroom under the Classics department. The professor
started swearing like a sailor, which I found pretty funny, but not for an
instructor that is about to teach you some English. Right after, I went to my
mentor and told him about the class. He introduced me to [[https://english.ku.edu/people/mary-klayder][Mary Klayder]], who is
called by many the "Queen of KU". That holds.  

She allowed me to switch from the regular English course into the Honors version
that she teaches. My man, it was great! She is one of those rare professors that
does care about you becoming more comfortable with the language, to be able to
freely express whatever you need or want through it. We read great books, wrote
papers, and went to her house for a pizza and fudge party. What more could I
possibly ask for?  

*** American Popular Culture of: Shlocks! Thrills!: Trash Cinema 

Now, this was one of the highlights of my semester. My first film class. It
wasn't some FILM 101 or intro to film composition, it was a sophomore-junior
level topics course in the film department that focused on trash movies. It was
one of my favorite classes and I still remember it very fondly. We only met once
a week, every Monday from 6 pm to 9 pm or even 10-ish. The first hour of the
time would be spent on lectures and quizzes and the last two-three on watching
trash movies plus discussion.  

My parents asked me, "What's the point of watching bad movies? Why not just
watch the good ones?". I can tell you now. By seeing and knowing where the
absolute trash and garbage is, really sets your frame of reference straight. So
many people would say "Oh my god dude, Twilight is the worst movie ever
made!". I would disagree. Have you ever seen "Pink Flamingos" by John Waters? It
made me appreciate regular movies for what they are. I have a [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/good_bad_movies/][small blog post]]
written on this exact question of watching good and bad movies.

The other immense advantage of taking this course is to learn the art of
enjoying art from all possible angles. For example, have you ever heard of a
movie being so bad that it's good? Just because of how bad it is? Yes, that is
what we focused on. Definitions like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch][Kitsch]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)][Camp]] can be applied to the
movies we watched: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room][The Room]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show][The Rocky Horror Picture Show]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarella_(film)][Barbarella]], [[https://youtu.be/pQxtZlQlTDA][Rose

and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(1996_film)][Crash]]. Loved it. Big thanks to [[https://film.ku.edu/people/ron-wilson][Ron Wilson]] for putting together such an
amazing class. I wondered about declaring a film minor for a while.  

*** First-Year Honors Seminar: Mathematics and Climate 

Now, this was a hoot. Every new Honors student has to take the mandatory
seminar, where each version of it revolves around topics of its Professor's
interests. Those seminars are small, with a maximum capacity of about 10-12
students. The appeal of the seminar is to introduce students to professors,
bridge that gap of authority, and let students feel more confident when talking
to faculty or even asking them for jobs and research positions.  

This is how I found my first research experience. My seminar was taught by the
amazing [[https://mathematics.ku.edu/people/erik-van-vleck][Erik Van Vleck]] on the topic of Mathematics and Climate. Basically, how
can we build a mathematical model of weather and climate? It would allow us to
better understand its highly chaotic behavior and predict future severe weather
conditions. I believe out of 20-ish seminars that run every year, our seminar
was the most intense one. We had to write essays, analysis, some MATLAB code,
and write a big final project on a topic of our own choice.  

My final project was titled "The Use of Neural Networks for Computing
Observation Operator in Data Assimilation Applications". That's a mouthful. It
was that time of my life when I was super interested in neural networks and tech
alike. I asked myself, can we apply this pattern recognition technique onto
chaotic equations of Data Assimilation? Take it a year more or so, this would
turn out into a research proposal that won the annual [[https://news.ku.edu/math-majors-receive-first-math-undergraduate-research-awards][math research grant]]. I
also assisted Professor Van Vleck with this same seminar for the next two years.  

*** Calculus II 

Speaking of classes that I could not test out of, I tested out of Calculus I! It
was a big relief that I don't have to relive the horrors of learning derivatives
and integrals for the first time. I can't say much about this course, as it
mostly consisted of mastering series, sequences, calculus theorems, integration
by parts, calculus+trigonometry, vectors, and such. It was that class, where you
do a lot of homework and attendance is mandatory. The fun part of the class was
the fact that it was taught by Professor Van Vleck!  

One lecture he jumped on the table and almost fell badly. The other day he came
to class wearing his shirt inside-out and people in class took the liberty to
point that out to him, we all laughed together afterward. He showed us some
[[https://youtu.be/uMSV4OteqBE][Spinal Tap memes]], fig man memes, and other stuff that I was too young to
understand. From that class, I do remember I peer of mine. For his privacy, call
him Roberto. Roberto was an interesting man, as almost every lecture, without a
fail, he would ask the professor if he could go to the bathroom mid-lecture.  

People have to understand that you don't have to ask that, especially in
college. You would just stand up and leave for some time. Roberto was set on
asking the professor, not even as a joke. One time, Professor Van Vleck told him
"You know, you don't have to ask me, you can just go.". About a week or two
later, during one of our lectures, I saw Roberto just rise up and quietly
leave. The moment the door shut after him, the whole class started
applauding. It was pretty funny, as the professor noted "You're all funny."  

There was one more incident with Roberto that in hindsight, was a little
sad. During lectures, we used a thing called [[https://www.iclicker.com][iClicker]]. An instructor would start
a poll and students would press their remotes to cast their vote/answer. Just
for giggles, our professor wanted to get a 100% in one of the questions and
started polling over a very simple question, with the intention that everyone
will get it right no matter what. That almost happened.  

Poll closed, votes cast, aaaaaand... everyone got it right! Except just for one
vote. I could hear Roberto raising his hand and asking in front of the whole
lecture audience why was that answer the correct one. Professor looked at him,
went to the blackboard, and uttered "So you have an equation here, and here is
the answer you think that is right". This is how it looked  

#+begin_src
  SOME EQUATION = (      ...      )
                  (      ...      )  = YOUR ANSWER
#+end_src

So a miracle occurs and you get your answer!

#+begin_src
  SOME EQUATION = (   A MIRACLE   )
                  (     OCCURS    )  = YOUR ANSWER
#+end_src

The burn was real. Let's end it here. It was fun
