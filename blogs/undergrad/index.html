<p>Being a senior in college is weird. I have to confess that I contracted
senioritis big time. So much has changed since my first time coming to
the University of Kansas. The change was very well expected, actually
desired. But what I failed to predict was the number of things that not
only will change but completely go away. Don&#8217;t forget about this whole
pandemic situation that happened right in the middle, kind of pushing me
off the grid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With everything that happened and in my current state, I wanted to
document my undergraduate career, while I still remember it and have the
energy and passion to write about. This post is a retrospection into
every single semester and every single course I have taken. I remember
everything. To keep it focused, this essay will only concentrate on
academic life, which is a smaller part of all my time, yet an important
one as well. <strong>CHARGE!</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome, everyone! My first semester at KU and university life in
general. I was a starry-eyed young incoming computer science freshman.
All I recall from the very beginning are emotions of excitement and
curiosity. As the first time living away from my parents and family, I&#8217;m
surprised how well I did. I haven&#8217;t gotten homesick for the first two
years in college. Making your bed? Going to the laundry? Figuring out
food? Spending however much time you want with your friends? My friend,
I loved it! The freedom of acting on my own and living through their
consequences is something I have desired for so long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an incoming freshman, we all had to talk to our advisors and get our
first semester courses all scheduled up. I was very fortunate to be
admitted into the Honors department at KU, which had the best advisory
board in the entire institution. I got my classic freshman-level
humanities classes, first programming class (even though I wasn&#8217;t new to
coding, I had to take it), and a movie class! Thanks to Ed Healy for
changing some random art history class on the other side of the campus
for what turned out to be one of my favorite classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_programming_i_honors">Programming I, Honors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first programming course in our department is denoted as EECS 168.
There is an Honors version that I took, which is just EECS 169. Have to
say, there is not much difference between the two. Same lectures, same
labs, and same exams. The only thing that sets it apart is an additional
problem Honors students have to do with every homework/lab. Ironically
enough, this doesn&#8217;t sound bad at all, but that single additional
problem tended to be more difficult than all of the other problems
combined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The course was primarily taught in C++. This was the God-chosen language
in our department. We all start by learning how to turn on a computer
(this is a jape). This course is more oriented for people that have
never done any computer programming before. You would learn the
fundamentals, such as for-loops, if-statements, functions, switches,
pointers, dynamic memory, and classes. I have done
<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/projects/memeinvestor_bot/">some</a>
<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/projects/collatz/">projects</a>
<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/projects/prequelmemes_bot/">before</a>, so all of the
material taught wasn&#8217;t new.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no way you can test out of this course. The department is
pretty adamant about you taking this course, even if you had plenty of
exposure to higher-level programming. I remember this was the first time
I would skip classes, forget when midterms are, and just show up late.
The hubris was building up. I met most of my closest friends now in that
class, as we would work together on labs and just hang out. All in all,
an amazing class taught by <a href="https://eecs.ku.edu/john-gibbons">John
Gibbons</a>. He was the best choice for intro CS courses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_honors_introduction_to_english">Honors Introduction to English</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everyone has to do what&#8217;s called the KU Core. Long story short, it&#8217;s a
set of courses that every single student at KU has to take. Just the
general education everyone has to go through. I think it is a really
good way to promote your student to be more well-rounded individuals. As
a part of the KU Core, every student has to take ENGL 102, which is your
basic old English class. Somehow, I haven&#8217;t been able to test out of it
with my IB score, so I got enrolled in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the first day of classes, I show up and we start doing introductions.
Dude, I didn&#8217;t like the professor and the vibe of the class the literal
moment I walked into that sad basement classroom under the Classics
department. The professor started swearing like a sailor, which I found
pretty funny, but not for an instructor that is about to teach you some
English. Right after, I went to my mentor and told him about the class.
He introduced me to <a href="https://english.ku.edu/people/mary-klayder">Mary
Klayder</a>, who is called by many the "Queen of KU". That holds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She allowed me to switch from the regular English course into the Honors
version that she teaches. My man, it was great! She is one of those rare
professors that does care about you becoming more comfortable with the
language, to be able to freely express whatever you need or want through
it. We read great books, wrote papers, and went to her house for a pizza
and fudge party. What more could I possibly ask for?</p>

<p>Now, this was one of the highlights of my semester. My first film class.
It wasn&#8217;t some FILM 101 or intro to film composition, it was a
sophomore-junior level topics course in the film department that focused
on trash movies. It was one of my favorite classes and I still remember
it very fondly. We only met once a week, every Monday from 6 pm to 9 pm
or even 10-ish. The first hour of the time would be spent on lectures
and quizzes and the last two-three on watching trash movies plus
discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My parents asked me, "What&#8217;s the point of watching bad movies? Why not
just watch the good ones?". I can tell you now. By seeing and knowing
where the absolute trash and garbage is, really sets your frame of
reference straight. So many people would say "Oh my god dude, Twilight
is the worst movie ever made!". I would disagree. Have you ever seen
"Pink Flamingos" by John Waters? It made me appreciate regular movies
for what they are. I have a
<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/good_bad_movies/">small blog post</a> written on
this exact question of watching good and bad movies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other immense advantage of taking this course is to learn the art of
enjoying art from all possible angles. For example, have you ever heard
of a movie being so bad that it&#8217;s good? Just because of how bad it is?
Yes, that is what we focused on. Definitions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch">Kitsch</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)">Camp</a> can be applied to the

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_first_year_honors_seminar_mathematics_and_climate">First-Year Honors Seminar: Mathematics and Climate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, this was a hoot. Every new Honors student has to take the mandatory
seminar, where each version of it revolves around topics of its
Professor&#8217;s interests. Those seminars are small, with a maximum capacity
of about 10-12 students. The appeal of the seminar is to introduce
students to professors, bridge that gap of authority, and let students
feel more confident when talking to faculty or even asking them for jobs
and research positions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is how I found my first research experience. My seminar was taught
by the amazing <a href="https://mathematics.ku.edu/people/erik-van-vleck">Erik Van
Vleck</a> on the topic of Mathematics and Climate. Basically, how can we
build a mathematical model of weather and climate? It would allow us to
better understand its highly chaotic behavior and predict future severe
weather conditions. I believe out of 20-ish seminars that run every
year, our seminar was the most intense one. We had to write essays,
analysis, some MATLAB code, and write a big final project on a topic of
our own choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My final project was titled "The Use of Neural Networks for Computing
Observation Operator in Data Assimilation Applications". That&#8217;s a
mouthful. It was that time of my life when I was super interested in
neural networks and tech alike. I asked myself, can we apply this
pattern recognition technique onto chaotic equations of Data
Assimilation? Take it a year more or so, this would turn out into a
research proposal that won the annual
<a href="https://news.ku.edu/math-majors-receive-first-math-undergraduate-research-awards">math
research grant</a>. I also assisted Professor Van Vleck with this same
seminar for the next two years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_calculus_ii">Calculus II</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking of classes that I could not test out of, I tested out of
Calculus I! It was a big relief that I don&#8217;t have to relive the horrors
of learning derivatives and integrals for the first time. I can&#8217;t say
much about this course, as it mostly consisted of mastering series,
sequences, calculus theorems, integration by parts,
calculus+trigonometry, vectors, and such. It was that class, where you
do a lot of homework and attendance is mandatory. The fun part of the
class was the fact that it was taught by Professor Van Vleck!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One lecture he jumped on the table and almost fell badly. The other day
he came to class wearing his shirt inside-out and people in class took
the liberty to point that out to him, we all laughed together afterward.
He showed us some <a href="https://youtu.be/uMSV4OteqBE">Spinal Tap memes</a>, fig
man memes, and other stuff that I was too young to understand. From that
class, I do remember I peer of mine. For his privacy, call him Roberto.
Roberto was an interesting man, as almost every lecture, without a fail,
he would ask the professor if he could go to the bathroom mid-lecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People have to understand that you don&#8217;t have to ask that, especially in
college. You would just stand up and leave for some time. Roberto was
set on asking the professor, not even as a joke. One time, Professor Van
Vleck told him "You know, you don&#8217;t have to ask me, you can just go.".
About a week or two later, during one of our lectures, I saw Roberto
just rise up and quietly leave. The moment the door shut after him, the
whole class started applauding. It was pretty funny, as the professor
noted "You&#8217;re all funny."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was one more incident with Roberto that in hindsight, was a little
sad. During lectures, we used a thing called
<a href="https://www.iclicker.com">iClicker</a>. An instructor would start a poll and
students would press their remotes to cast their vote/answer. Just for
giggles, our professor wanted to get a 100% in one of the questions and
started polling over a very simple question, with the intention that
everyone will get it right no matter what. That almost happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Poll closed, votes cast, aaaaaand‚Ä¶ everyone got it right! Except just
for one vote. I could hear Roberto raising his hand and asking in front
of the whole lecture audience why was that answer the correct one.
Professor looked at him, went to the blackboard, and uttered "So you
have an equation here, and here is the answer you think that is right".
This is how it looked</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SOME EQUATION = (      ...      )
                (      ...      )  = YOUR ANSWER</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"So a miracle occurs and you get your answer!"</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SOME EQUATION = (   A MIRACLE   )
                (     OCCURS    )  = YOUR ANSWER</pre>

<p>The first semester is done! And to say the least, it was a blast. What
freedom, what fun, and here is to the new friends with the new semester
on the horizon. Let&#8217;s see what I remember from this semester. This is
the time when I took an <strong>amazing</strong> math class that convinced me to
declare and pursue a whole math major. In some parts, it was a little
bit of a tough semester, compared to the first one. Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before that real quick, I went to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_and_Applied_Mathematical_Sciences_Institute">SAMSI</a>

all over the nation. And there was me, a single KU student from Midwest.</p>

<p>Not a lot can be said here because this is simply an awesome course
taught by one and only, Ryan Stangler. As he said, "not Strangler". I
can&#8217;t find his website or anything about him on the internet, so I&#8217;ll
link his 207 pages long thesis on
<a href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/19555">The Agrarian Rhetoric of
Richard M. Weaver</a>. This class left a big imprint in my memory, all
thanks to Ryan Stangler&#8217;s incredible charisma and life within him. I
always like to quote Oscar Wilde, once he said</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is
all.</em> ‚Äì Oscar Wilde</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Out of all the people I have met during my lifetime and all across the
world, I can confidently say that Ryan Stangler is one of those very few
that truly lived, and still living! The class was about public speaking,
so we would write speeches with various goals, such as an introductory
speech, an informative one, and a persuasive one, where you try to
persuade the audience on whatever topic you are doing. My persuasive
speech on why we should use the Holocene calendar is
<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/year_12019/">published on my website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One day, he had a bet with his fellow professor. That professor told him
that if he gives us the extremely controversial
<a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/">Flight
93 Election</a>, then he would get fired. We had to write a paper analyzing
the article and expressing our critical views on it. The courage on that
man. On some days, he would just ditch any plans and give us some
link:./language packet that is good for your soul.pdf[readings for our
soul] and read it out loud with fiery passion during the class. Love
that man.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_programming_ii">Programming II</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EECS 268 is a direct continuation of EECS 168, which was the first
programming course, also taught by John Gibbons. This class has a bit of
a reputation for being the "beast class" of our computer science
curriculum. The pass-rate of this class, meaning any students graduating
(getting at least C-) is about 40%. Many people fear this class, yet
every single EECS student has to go through it. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that
bad, let me explain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This class is of course harder than EECS 168, you start doing some
interesting data structures and algorithms, like linked lists, binary
trees, hash tables, recursion, backtracking, permutations, etc. This is
the first real taste of what programming entails and that&#8217;s long hours
sitting in front of the computer screen, reading stack traces and
compiler errors, wasting yourself away debugging your code, and hunting
down every possible memory leak in your orthodox C++ code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an important material that every CS student has to know and
master, however, many people that are pursuing computer science realize
that this major and field might not be in their best interests. Simply
put, they have talents and aspirations in something different. Going
into the tech industry is driven mainly by chasing the bag or chasing
the bag. Think of Programming II as a trial by fire for the ones that
are not meant for this kind of life. They should realize that and have
the courage to properly act on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should also note that if someone passes the course, it does not mean
the rest of the curriculum will be easy or they are great computer
scientists. It just means you did well enough on foundational data
structures, wrapped your head around recursion, or maybe allegedly
cheated your way through by collaborating on individual projects. I
enjoyed the class. My friends and I were in a frenzy, where we would try
to write "smartest" and "smallest" code possible for our exercises. Just
for fun, of course.</p>

<p>ENGL 205 is a direct sequel to ENGL 105, which I took last semester. The
big difference is that this one is completely optional. I enrolled in
Mary Klayder&#8217;s English course just because I wanted to. We read books
and wrote papers. The part of the class I remember the most is that time
we all went to her house again to have some pizzas and fudge. She has a
small cinema theater in her basement, where we would sit down and give
small presentations about ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel this is the time when I fell in love with interacting with
professors and my classmates outside of class, even more so than when we
were in the classroom. It helps you to get over the fear and shyness of
talking to faculty just because you enjoy talking to them. In her house,
I did a small standup-like bit while sitting a small wooden stool.
Shamelessly ripped it off from my public speaking course&#8217;s intro speech.</p>

Calculus III, there were only nine of us there. Instead of sitting in
boring 200+ person lecture halls, we had more of a classroom
environment, where we all became good friends. Professor Gavosto would
run fun lectures, bring candies to exams, treat everyone with some
pumpkin bread to teach triple integrals, and have some cookies with milk
for our final. She was called the mom of the class.</p>

<p>Do not let that fool you though. MATH 147 is a hard class, one of the
hardest classes on that level, I daresay. In the Honors version, we
cover about double the amount of material of what the main course does
and we also did projects throughout the semester. For example, for the
first project, Professor gave each one of us a noodle, like the ones you
like to eat, all in different shapes and we had to come up with
mathematical equations and sets to plot it.</p>

<p>I got an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orecchiette">Orecchiette</a> pasta,
which you can see above. I thought of some ways I can plot it. Maybe a
half of a sphere with lifted wings? Not Cartesian. I settled on making
it work with Cylindrical coordinates because it is more doable to add
those ridges on the pasta&#8217;s surface. The result is as follows</p>

<p>Assume that the surface \(S\) of this pasta is parametrized by
the equations</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>\(\vec{r}(t,a)=\begin{cases}x(t,a)=0.9 t \cos (a)\\y(t,a) = t \sin (a)\\z(t,a) = 0.06\sqrt{t} (1.21\, -t) \sin (22.5 t \cos (a))\\\qquad\qquad-0.08 t^2 \sin (2 a)+\frac{1}{2} t^6-t</sup>4-0.1 t^2+1\end{cases}\)</p>

<p>Then we started working altogether in teams of four. My pasta was chosen
as the team&#8217;s pasta, so we went on to running
<a href="./math147_project2.pdf">analysis</a> on my small noodle, like finding
the vector field of it, and more! Finally, Professor Gavosto gave us a
set of equations to plot a ravioli, with a separate set for the top, the
bottom of the ravioli, and its filling as well. I

<p>I never liked physics and this class was no exception. PHSX 210 at KU is
mostly an extremely mediocre experience, where you are simply required
to cram the material and spit it back out during weirdly formatted
quizzes and exams. The single thing I remember from this course is that
I didn&#8217;t have the best homework and work ethic there, simply because I
couldn&#8217;t care less.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our homework was due every Wednesday at 9 am. A responsible student
would do the homework the night before or even sooner. I would wake up
every Wednesday at around 5 am and give myself 3-4 hours at max to do
it. Everyone is sleeping, meaning there is no help available. What
happens if I can&#8217;t do a problem? Too bad. I got an A in that class by
being 0.1% over the A cutoffs. One sneeze in the wrong direction,
straight to the B land.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to talk about this. This was just an excel class, where you
would make what&#8217;s called a "master" excel file, punch in numbers you
collect during experiments, and crunch out that data.</p>

<p>This was by far the darkest semester I have had up until then. I was
called <em>suicidal</em> and <em>crazy</em> for taking a semester of 6 courses (18
credit hours), where each course was an Honors class. Recall that Honors
classes can be twice as hard as their regular versions.</p>
