* Ghostty is pretty cool ðŸ‘»

Having tried using [[https://alacritty.org/][Alacritty]] for a few months a few years ago left a bit of a
bitter aftertaste with shoddy multi-monitor support, custom fonts, lack of macos
compatibility (the app icon would behave erratically), and the ``Rewrite in
Rust'' stench. Seeing the news of [[https://ghostty.org/][Ghostty]] [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517447][going 1.0]], why not give it a try? This
would be the first time of me giving a shot to a new terminal emulator in two
years' time.

This one, however, feels like holding a good sturdy piece of hardware that you
know is of high quality and will serve you for many years to come. Sensible
defaults with a [[https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference][friendly way]] to configure it to your liking---even with some
[[https://ghostty.zerebos.com][slick tooling]]. I intend on using it for the foreseeable future, so I'll treat
this page as a living document to store my configuration as it breathes and
changes throughout time.
