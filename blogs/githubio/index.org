* Your Domains and Github Pages ðŸ¦‰

May 23rd, 2020

Github Pages is a beatiful thing for static website hosting. If you have a
github account with username =myname= and create a repo called
=myname.github.io=, you officially have a static website that you can access by
just going to =https://myname.github.io=! I used it for about 2-3 years now. A
man has to grow up and finally have his own domain. This is a quick post about
how to make it happen. 

Let's say you bought your domain =myname.com=. First thing to do, go to your
domain dashboard and set the following in your domain's custom records:

#+begin_src
| Name | Type  | TTL |              Data |
|------+-------+-----+-------------------|
| @    | A     | 1h  |   185.199.108.153 |
|      |       |     |   185.199.109.153 |
|      |       |     |   185.199.110.153 |
|      |       |     |   185.199.111.153 |
| www  | CNAME | 1h  | myname.github.io. |
#+end_src

After that, go to your =myname.github.io= repo's settings and in the section
*Github Pages*, fill in your custom domain and tick the *Enforce HTTPS*
option. Now, just wait. You might get bad redirects, bad certificates, etc. Give
it couple of minutes up to an hour to start working properly.

Voila, you're done!
