* WebP is such a goated format ü´ê

93; 12022 H.E.

** Motivation

I have been toying around with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP][WebP]] for a couple of weeks now. Convert this
image into webp and try to use it instead of traditional png. It was pretty
crazy for me to see an up to 10x image size reduction, yet very little to no
visual difference with a naked human eye.

Some further reading led me to some pleasant discoveries, such as lossy and
lossless compression, transparency with an alpha channel, metadata, animation
(!) support, and a wide adoption by major browsers and graphics software over
the past decade or so.

This is truly some state-of-the-art stuff. Even as claiming an average of 45%
reduction in file size with wild PNGs found on the web and a 28% reduction
compared to PNGs that are recompressed with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pngcrush][pngcrush]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNGOUT][PNGOUT]].[fn:: [[http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/lossless-and-transparency-encoding-in.html][Lossless
and transparency encoding in WebP]]] I should try this now!

** The migration

The process of moving from PNG to WebP was painless. I rigged a quick =find= and
=sed= script to go through all my directories and convert images with
[[https://imagemagick.org][ImageMagick]]. Another quick regex to find corresponding file links and references
in org files, and replace them with anew webp format. It all took no more than
15 to 20 minutes. I talked to Darkness to [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness/commit/85a89d871bcb272b9c2b7b36d02af67132dac834][support variable preview files]] aaaannd
*push!*

Wow, /it just works/. Even GitHub Pages deploys it in about halftime now. Let me
see if we got any file size gains. I'll archive the whole website into two tar
files: before and after webp changes (=.git= of course excluded).

#+begin_src sh
  sandyuraz:source* Œª ls -lh *.tar
  -rw-r--r--  1 thecsw  staff   279M Apr  3 15:33 png.tar
  -rw-r--r--  1 thecsw  staff   108M Apr  3 15:33 webp.tar
#+end_src

*This is very nice*. It's less than half of what it was before! Going through
some of the pages, even my eye can't spot any differences that would be
noticeable. WebP is good for all the stuff on the web. Choose your image formats
based on your needs and requirements. For now, WebP looks like a great
alternative. Thank you!

*Update*: hi, this page got a [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31010659][little traction]] on HackerNews. I want to note that
there are formats that are meant to supersede WebP, such as AVIF and JPEG XL,
however, [[https://caniuse.com/avif][AVIF]] (69.25%) and [[https://caniuse.com/jpegxl][JPEG XL]] (0%) are not as nearly adopted as [[https://caniuse.com/webp][WebP]] is
(91.38%). Usage taken on April 13th, 2022. Also, get a browser released
after 2013. 

** Example?

Let's try to grab a picture in PNG format, convert it to WebP and see how the
file size and image quality differ between those two. I'll have both examples
from an amazing photographer [[https://mobile.twitter.com/shnimohus][@shnimohus]], whose shots *I absolutely adore*.

Below is the ImageMagick version I will be using when simply running
=convert source.png target.webp=

#+begin_src sh
  Version: ImageMagick 7.1.0-29 Q16-HDRI x86_64 19841 https://imagemagick.org
  Copyright: (C) 1999 ImageMagick Studio LLC
  License: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php
  Features: Cipher DPC HDRI Modules OpenMP(5.0)
  Delegates (built-in): bzlib fontconfig freetype gslib heic jng jp2 jpeg lcms lqr ltdl lzma openexr png ps tiff webp xml zlib
  Compiler: gcc (4.2)
#+end_src

Let's see an example!

Here is a shot of a bus stop in PNG, weighing at around 2.4MB

[[booth.png][This is the PNG version]]

As a comparison, here is the WebP generated from it, which is only about 258KB

[[booth.webp][This is the WebP version]]

For the sake of the experiment, try to dowload both files and see if you can
spot any differences.

Here is one more example!

[[town.png][This PNG is around 3.9MB]]

With its counterpart generated with =convert town.png town.webp=

[[town.webp][This WebP is only around 462KB]]

Is this experiment biased? Definitely. I could have used some PNG compression
techniques, go through ImageMagick's documentation to fine-tune the
conversion. However, the big point here is that without doing any of that, WebP
seems to keep the quality I prefer while also reducing the size (doesn't matter
to me whether it's lossy or lossless).

Thank you!
