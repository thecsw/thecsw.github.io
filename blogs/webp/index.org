* WebP is such a goated format ü´ê

93; 12022 H.E.

I have been toying around with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP][WebP]] for a couple of weeks now. Convert this
image into webp and try to use it instead of traditional png. It was pretty
crazy for me to see an up to 10x image size reduction, yet very little to no
visual difference with a naked human eye.

Some further reading led me to some pleasant discoveries, such as lossy and
lossless compression, transparency with an alpha channel, metadata, animation
(!) support, and a wide adoption by major browsers and graphics software over
the past decade or so.

This is truly some state-of-the-art stuff. Even as claiming an average of 45%
reduction in file size with wild PNGs found on the web and a 28% reduction
compared to PNGs that are recompressed with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pngcrush][pngcrush]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNGOUT][PNGOUT]].[fn:: [[http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/lossless-and-transparency-encoding-in.html][Lossless
and transparency encoding in WebP]]] I should try this now!

The process of moving from PNG to WebP was painless. I rigged a quick =find= and
=sed= script to go through all my directories and convert images with
[[https://imagemagick.org][ImageMagick]]. Another quick regex to find corresponding file links and references
in org files, and replace them with anew webp format. It all took no more than
15 to 20 minutes. I talked to Darkness to [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness/commit/85a89d871bcb272b9c2b7b36d02af67132dac834][support variable preview files]] aaaannd
*push!*

Wow, /it just works/. Even GitHub Pages deploys it in about halftime now. Let me
see if we got any file size gains. I'll archive the whole website into two tar
files: before and after webp changes (=.git= of course excluded).

#+begin_src sh
  sandyuraz:source* Œª ls -lh *.tar
  -rw-r--r--  1 thecsw  staff   279M Apr  3 15:33 png.tar
  -rw-r--r--  1 thecsw  staff   108M Apr  3 15:33 webp.tar
#+end_src

*This is very nice*. It's less than half of what it was before! Going through
some of the pages, even my eye can't spot any differences that would be
noticeable. WebP is good for all the stuff on the web. Choose your image formats
based on your needs and requirements. For now, WebP looks like a great
alternative. Thank you!
