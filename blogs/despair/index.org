* Anime as collective despair ü•ú

Taken from a conversation with my best friend. Why is more and more of modern
media portrays dystopias and children fighting for freedom? Why has anime lost
that certain kind of warmth to it? A small note,

Allow me to be a bit sentimental, I liked this thread a lot and the

‚Äúreborn/reincarnated/transported to another world as a _" has matured and gotten
popular to the point of being its own genre with associated tropes, rather than
just being a trope that would sometimes appear in fantasy stories.

I think of it this way: As the current world everyone lives in is devoid of
meaning - you have to escape inside or to fantasy in order to find
meaning. Disenchantment is the mood of the day. With the internet competition
among local people becomes a bit moot. Economically everything is irreversibly
and increasingly owned by the investor class and its likely that everyone will
have more modest goods than their parents had.

Where and how do you find a purpose, a meaning against such a backdrop? This is
the question that artists and writers are trying to answer. Defeating inner
demons, finding connection and community, fighting an uncaring out of touch
older class.. all sorts of theories are there.

In response,

I'd agree - there's a reason that the protagonists in these are almost always
unemployed shutins or people that are half-dead from overwork even before they
have their unfortunate encounter with a truck.

Either you can't find work, or it's a soul crushing march towards death while
performing meaningless work to make someone else rich while receiving no
appreciation for it.

Japan has been facing a lot of these issues for longer than a lot of the rest of
the developed world, but it increasingly seems like they were just a bit ahead
of the curve in it happening.

Japan has always been ahead of the curve.
If you think about it, a lot of recent movies, not only coming from Japan or
Eastern hemisphere, but Western media produce content primarily with future
dystopia feelings, teenagers being oppressed by some investor class or old
propel with money, and how they have to overthrow them to bring balance and
dignity back in people‚Äôs hands. Popularized by hunger games and maze runner, and
in Japan before that.

Of course not to read too deep into it at all or why is the door blue, this is
quite a shallow analysis, but there is something of‚Äîa big psychological shift in
how we perceive the world and how it treats us back, and not in a good way. Mark
Twain said, ‚Äúthe world doesn‚Äôt owe you anything, it was here first‚Äù and ok‚Äîit
doesn‚Äôt help, justify, or explain the kind of collective despair experienced by
people en masse, yet lacking any real uniting principle or a common goal to band
together, make our voices heard, or even at the least acknowledge that it is
dehumanizing of the situation that modern people are put into.

The argument of ‚Äúsuck it up, buttercup‚Äù or ‚Äúit was bad too in the past‚Äù are
incredibly naive, ignorant, or straight up evil. The whole point of us living
and trying to do anything is to see improvement in our lives, futures, and
general well-being of everyone around us. If older generations bring down the
newer generations, either because of jealousy or malice, they can‚Äôt let them be
better than they are‚Äîthen there isn‚Äôt a lot left to do for us, but wait until
it‚Äôs too expensive to ‚Äúown‚Äù anything, have kids, or anything of sorts‚Äîhaving
population grow older with fewer young working adults and having the more senior
populace die and wallow in their own work.

Interesting thread and thoughts.
I‚Äôve been thinking about this too.
I do think the popularity of isekai says something about society and a desire to
escape from somewhere you aren‚Äôt appreciated to somewhere you are.
Also that most protags are self insert.
The world can be a sad place to live sometimes.

Can you blame people for seeking that?
