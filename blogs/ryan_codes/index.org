* Programmer Ryan Gosling üë®‚Äçüíª

April 2nd, 2020

Memes are great and in many ways, *define* who we are. Couple of months ago, I
found one of the best meme goldmines. [[https://programmerryangosling.tumblr.com/][Programmer Ryan Gosling]] I fell in love
with it instantly. I love Ryan since the first time I saw him in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(2011_film)][Drive]] and I who
doesn't enjoy a bit of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/][r/ProgrammerHumor]]? Unfortunately, the stream of content
discontinued since Feb 14th, 2014 (/what a coincidence/). Heart breaking. My
good friend, Malena and I tried to make few of them and post here. If you wish
to submit some for our own amusements and yours, feel free to send it to
