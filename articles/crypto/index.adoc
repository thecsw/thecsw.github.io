.Abstract


This page covers some pretty neat cryptography stuff from my
http://witt.faculty.ku.edu/math601s20/[MATH 601] class, which is all
about cryptography and the fantastic math backbone behind it. What you
see on this page is either directly from my class notes or my
interpretation of it. I'll tell you a secret, I use this page just to
brush up my stuff on it and to be in shape for all the surprise quizzes.
You can find not only the math behind, but real-life crypo systems, code
to implement the math and crypto, and some cool tricks to solve some
stuff that I probably learned the hard way.
