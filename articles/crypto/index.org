* Notes on Cryptography

** Abstract
This page covers some pretty neat cryptography stuff from my [[http://witt.faculty.ku.edu/math601s20/][MATH 601]] class,
which is all about cryptography and the fantastic math backbone behind it. What
you see on this page is either directly from my class notes or my interpretation
of it. I'll tell you a secret, I use this page just to brush up my stuff on it
and to be in shape for all the surprise quizzes. You can find not only the math
behind, but real-life crypo systems, code to implement the math and crypto, and
some cool tricks to solve some stuff that I probably learned the hard way.
