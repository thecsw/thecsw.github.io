* Using Foundation-style Time 💫

197; 12020 H.E.

Just recently, I've finally finished the original Foundation trilogy by Isaac
Asimov. I've probably read the first book about three times in the last four
years but I could never get my hands on the remaining two (/Foundation and
Empire/, /Second Foundation/). Not going too deep into the series, I just want
to say they are life-changing, in a good way. 

During my read, I saw an interesting date format used by Galactic Empire and
Foundation in the form of =DAY OF THE YEAR; YEAR ERA TIME=. Something about it
gave me an idea of switching my timestamps from traditional *Wednesday, July
15th 2020 09:09 PM* to *197; 12020 H.E 2109*. I wrote a quick webpage that shows
[[https://sandyuraz.com/time][your current local time]] in this format. Why year 12020? I have [[../year_12019][a post]] on that.

This is it. Something about this way of stamping time motivates me and inspires
me. So much for me being a sci-fi romantic 🤷🏻‍♀️

Also, if you use XFCE, here is a clock format you can use: =%j; 1%Y H.E. %H%M=
or =%j; 1%Y H.E. %H%M.%S= to also show dot-separated seconds counter
