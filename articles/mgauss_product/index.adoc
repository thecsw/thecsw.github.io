.Abstract


MVN or multivariate Gaussian distribution is a generalization of the
univariate normal distribution that we all love and dread. While taking
a computational data science class, we had to find the unnormalized
product of two joint normal distributions (MVN). There doesn't seem to
be much literature on that; I wanted to write down how we can approach
the problem and test my mathjax to its limits.

== Solution

We know that MVN has the PDF form
