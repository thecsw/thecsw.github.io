* Prettifying Org Mode with CSS ðŸ’…

Org Mode HTML output can look like [[https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/][this webpage]], but as its [[http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/][big brother]]
rightfully states, a /grotesque pile of shit/. Same goes for orgmode. I wrote a
very small CSS file that you can add to your orgmode header and the output
should smoother

You can just add this line here:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sandyuraz.com/styles/org.min.css">
#+END_SRC

Even a really little makeup can make a big difference! That's why I prefer Dior
