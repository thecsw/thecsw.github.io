Prettifying Org Mode with CSS ðŸ’…
===============================

May 9th, 2020

Org Mode HTML output can look like [this
webpage](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), but as its [big
brother](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) rightfully states, a
*grotesque pile of shit*. Same goes for orgmode. I wrote a very small
CSS file that you can add to your orgmode header and the output should
smoother

You can just add this line here or just use the bare CSS as a starting
point to make your own (everyone has their own style):

``` {.org}
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sandyuraz.com/styles/org.min.css">
```

Even a really little makeup can make a big difference! There is a good
discussion about this article on
