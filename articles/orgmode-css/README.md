Prettifying Org Mode with CSS ðŸ’…
===============================

May 9th, 2020

Org Mode HTML output can look like [this
webpage](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), but as its [big
brother](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) rightfully states, a
*grotesque pile of shit*. Same goes for orgmode. I wrote a very small
CSS file that you can add to your orgmode header and the output should
smoother

You can just add this line here:

``` {.org}
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sandyuraz.com/styles/org.min.css">
```

Even a really little makeup can make a big difference! That\'s why I
prefer Dior
