* Getting Sandy's .emacs.d ðŸ¤º

212; 12020 H.E.

After years of carefully cultivating and taking care of my =.emacs.d= config
files, I thought it may be time to try and share it, maybe someone will like it 

I host my =.emacs.d= on [[https://github.com/thecsw/.emacs.d][github]], however, it depends on some LSP quirks and go
tools that I decided writing a quick shell script to do the work. You can visit
the config's webpage [[https://sandyuraz.com/.emacs.d][here]]. 

All you have to run is the curl command below in your home directory (=~=)

NOTE: existing installation will move to .bak append

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/master/sh/emacs.sh | sh
#+END_SRC

It will clone =.emacs.d=, symlink =.emacs=, and optionally install golang X
tools (considering you have Go installed)
