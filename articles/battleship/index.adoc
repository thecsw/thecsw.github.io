I was given a small project to write a (stripped down) battleship game
in Haskell. With me having almost no experience in Haskell and extremely
pure languages. Writing this small code felt something close to doing
time and I want to save this as one of my greatest achievements.

This is haskell from a point of view of knowing no haskell.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)[Battleship] is a classic
PvP game for two players. Each player has his own board with some ships
placed around the field and those are unknown to the other player. Each
player takes alternate turns trying to shoot down all the ships by
guessing locations.

This version only has 1 ship for each player. This will be fun.
