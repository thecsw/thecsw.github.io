May 7th, 2020

I have been a full-time emacs user for the past 4 years and I have been
working in Golang professionally for about 2 years now. Combining those
two beauties is quite a task with so many different modules and addons
available. This is a comfortable setup I found for myself and I wish to
share it. _Demo below!_

== Getting dependencies

One of many great things about Go is its tooling environment. You can
write any tools and implement your ideas with ease.

First tool you need is usually https://golang.org/[Go itself]. After
that, install some of the go tools dependencies below:

[source,bash]
----
% go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
% go get -u github.com/rogpeppe/godef
% go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
----

Next we need to install some of the emacs dependencies through
https://melpa.org[MELPA]. This is gonna be big, prep your `.emacs.d` for
some fun time compiling elisp. Refresh your local repo of packages by
running kbd:[M-x package-refresh-contents]. You can install packages by
running kbd:[M-x package-install PACKAGE-NAME]

Here is the list:

* https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete[auto-complete] - An
Intelligent auto-completion extension for Emacs
* https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el[go-mode] - Emacs mode for the
Go programming language
* https://github.com/vibhavp/go-complete[go-complete] - Native Go
completion for Emacs
* https://melpa.org/#/go-autocomplete[go-autocomplete] -
auto-complete-mode backend for go-mode
* https://github.com/capitaomorte/autopair[autopair] - Automagically
pair braces and quotes in emacs like TextMate

== Config

You can just put this in your `.emacs` or whatever init file you're
using. The following config is all you need to get yourself started with
automatic code formatting, code completion, parenthesis matching, dot
completion (!), and jump to definition.

[source,commonlisp]
----
;; Init the auto complete modules
(ac-config-default)
(global-auto-complete-mode t)
(require 'go-autocomplete)

;; Enable auto-complete
(auto-complete-mode 1)

;; Define keymaps
(define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-TAB") 'auto-complete)
(global-set-key (kbd"C-c C-c") 'godef-jump)

;; Set some quick config vals
(setq ac-auto-start 1)
(setq ac-auto-show-menu 0.8)

;; Just to make sure go tools are enabled
(add-to-list 'exec-path "~/go/bin")

;; Automatically format code on save
(setq gofmt-command "goimports")
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'gofmt-before-save)
(add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'auto-complete-for-go)
----

After that, just reload your emacs and you should have full go
environment installed!
