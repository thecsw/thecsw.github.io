* Becoming an emacs gopher üêó

May 8th, 2020

I have been a full-time emacs user for the past 4 years and I have been working
in Golang professionally for about 2 years now. Combining those two beauties is
quite a task with so many different modules and addons available. I believe I
found an example of a modular and a comfortable setup.

** Getting dependencies

One of many great things about Go is its tooling environment. You can write any
tools and implement your ideas with ease. 

First tool you need is usually [[https://golang.org/][Go itself]]. After that, install some of the
go tools dependencies below:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
  go get -u github.com/rogpeppe/godef
  go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
#+END_SRC

Next we need to install some of the emacs dependencies through [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]]. This is
gonna be big, prep your =.emacs.d= for some fun time compiling elisp. Refresh
your local repo of packages by running kbd:[M-x package-refresh-contents].
You can install packages by running kbd:[M-x package-install PACKAGE-NAME]

Here is the list:
 - [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-complete]]
 - [[https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el][go-mode]]
 - [[https://github.com/vibhavp/go-complete][go-complete]]
 - [[https://melpa.org/#/go-autocomplete][go-autocomplete]]
 - [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/autopair][autopair]]

** Config

You can just put this in your =.emacs= or whatever init file you're using. The
following config is all you need to get yourself started with automatic code
formatting, code completion, parenthesis matching, dot completion (!), and jump
to definition.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Init the auto complete modules
  (ac-config-default)
  (global-auto-complete-mode t)
  (require 'go-autocomplete)

  ;; Enable auto-complete
  (auto-complete-mode 1)

  ;; Define keymaps
  (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-TAB") 'auto-complete)
  (global-set-key (kbd"C-c C-c") 'godef-jump)

  ;; Set some quick config vals
  (setq ac-auto-start 1)
  (setq ac-auto-show-menu 0.8)

  ;; Just to make sure go tools are enabled
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "~/go/bin")

  ;; Automatically format code on save
  (setq gofmt-command "goimports")
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'gofmt-before-save)
  (add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'auto-complete-for-go)
#+END_SRC

After that, just reload your emacs and you should have full go environment
installed!
