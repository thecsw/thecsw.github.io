Here are some presentations made for academia (tutoring, fun topics,
etc.)

== Sandy's Tutor Notes for Spring 2021 üìù

During Spring 2021 semester, I worked as a tutor for the School of
Engineering. As one of the tutors, we held multiple a series of study
sessions every week, on subjects and classes ranging from Calculus
I/II/II to Phyics I/II and Chemistry I/II.

I took digital notes on my tablet during every meeting and they have
just been fully documented on a separate webpage. I taught Calculus II,
Calculus III, and Physics I. It was a lot of fun!

If you are a student and struggling with some of the courses above, you
can look at the notes as a bank of problems with detailed solutions. As
a tutor or a grader or a teaching assistant, you would be able to find a
good source of teaching material and the curriculum of those courses.

== Oracles for Ordinary Differential Equations üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I also worked as a grader for Ordinary Differential Equations course
(MATH 220), taught by Professor Van Vleck from the department of
Mathematics at University of Kansas. Interestingly enough, one of my
responsibilities was also typing up all the weekly homework solutions so
that they can be used as "oracles", i.e. "source of truth" when grading
students' submissions.

This was quite an experience, because it has been a while since my intro
ODE class. In a way, it felt like taking another courseload, as I had to
type everything in LaTeX. Solutions are available both in the web form
(rendered by https://www.mathjax.org[MathJax]) and in PDF form (rendered
with https://www.latex-project.org[LaTeX]). This might be a good source
to catch up on your ODEs!

== L'H√¥pital's Rule üè•

Before I became a tutor at the School of Engineering, as one of the
support materials I made for Calculus II was a quick web presentation on
L'H√¥pital's Rule, its importance and the motivation behind it.
