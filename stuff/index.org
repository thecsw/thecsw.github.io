* Cool stuff 🦎  
** Compiler Written in C++ from Scratch 🍺
   C-rona is a fantastic a general-purpose, procedural, imperative, and
   statically-typed programming language written in C++. Our final project
   contains a fully working compiler for x86_64 machines, which itself was a
   semester-long project for EECS 665: Compiler Construction, where we learned
   the art of building compilers from scratch and this is the result. 
   
   EECS 665: Compiler Construction was taught by fantastic [[https://ittc.ku.edu/~drew/][Drew Davidson]], who
   made probably one of the classicaly toughest courses in undergraduate career
   into one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken in my Computer
   Science undergrad. I must boast a little bit here and confess that this might
   objectively be the best engineering course at my university and probably the
   best compilers course work globally.

   I worked on the project with [[https://github.com/zatkins-dev][Zachary Atkins]] and without him I wouldn't have
   gotten anywhere. We were great partners throughout the whole semester.

** Sandy's Tutor Notes for Spring 2021 📝
   During Spring 2021 semester, I worked as a tutor for the School of
   Engineering. As one of the tutors, we held multiple a series of study
   sessions every week, on subjects and classes ranging from Calculus I/II/III
   to Phyics I/II and Chemistry I/II.

   I took digital notes on my tablet during every meeting and they have just
   been fully documented on a separate webpage. I taught Calculus II, Calculus
   III, and Physics I. It was a lot of fun!

   If you are a student and struggling
   with some of the courses above, you can look at the notes as a bank of
   problems with detailed solutions. As a tutor or a grader or a teaching
   assistant, you would be able to find a good source of teaching material and
   the curriculum of those courses.

** Oracles for Ordinary Differential Equations 🧎‍♀️
   I also worked as a grader for Ordinary Differential Equations course (MATH
   220), taught by Professor Van Vleck from the department of Mathematics at
   University of Kansas. Interestingly enough, one of my responsibilities was
   also typing up all the weekly homework solutions so that they can be used as
   "oracles", i.e. "source of truth" when grading students' submissions.

   This was quite an experience, because it has been a while since my intro ODE
   class. In a way, it felt like taking another courseload, as I had to type
   everything in LaTeX. Solutions are available both in the web form (rendered
   by [[https://www.mathjax.org][MathJax]]) and in PDF form (rendered with [[https://www.latex-project.org][LaTeX]]). This might be a good
   source to catch up on your ODEs!

** L'Hôpital's Rule 🏥
   Before I became a tutor at the School of Engineering, as one of the support
   materials I made for Calculus II was a quick web presentation on L'Hôpital's
   Rule, its importance and the motivation behind it.
