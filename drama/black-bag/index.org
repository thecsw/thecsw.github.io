* Black Bag
Black Bag goes down like a glass of clean sharp martini—no brine, no olives, and
definitely more gin than vermouth. It never loses its focus, never goes onto a
tangent that is left unresolved, never does something that doesn't feed into its
larger story. Drinking it feels refreshing and reassuring that spy thrillers
like this still get written and produced. It's somewhat similar to "Tinker
Tailor Soldier Spy," but more modern and carries that boutique store vibe to
it. I have enjoyed it thoroughly—don't think I would be watching it again any
time soon—Black Bag did its homework by knowing exactly what it is and what it
is not.

My god is Fassbender hot. Cate Blanchett has the daggers in her eyes that can
cut boulders into the tiniest of pieces. Pierce Brosnan is Pierce Brosnan. The
cast alone makes this worth a watch.
