* Runaway Bride

Didn't know much about it but that my mom loves Richard Gere and after seeing
it---I understand why. That's it. Not to oversimplify, but following a story of
a girl that is scared of commitment, where dumping three guys at the altar in
succession *and* continuing to live in the same small town middle of nowhere is
crazy. I liked the twist and the general feel of the movie, but nothing much to
hold on to or to think about.
