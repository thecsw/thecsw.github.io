This really had no reason to be this good. Met with an utmost difficult task with choosing a movie to watch on a plane on Christmas Eve that is shorter than two-ish hours—to my surprise, I will confess–Delta had a catalogue of Criterion movies you could choose from their in-flight infotainment screen. I recall having <em>The Daytrippers</em> in my watchlist for a while, so the choice was pretty clear. I will repeat; this really had <strong>no</strong> business being this good. Like, what?
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Every hero in the story is such an epitome, such a distillation of characters you meet throughout life or have to share said life with them. Harboring both the likable and dislikable traits at the same time is what makes us human in the first place. <em>The Daytrippers</em> combines all these different people in a story that we all know too well; if not the exact story of hunting down your husband in suspicion of infidelity, but in the story of spending supremely uncomfortable time in the same car or throughout the day with your in-laws, disagreeable people, crooks, liars, and whoever.

The scenes where the mother Rita, played by Anne Meara was talking to her daughter’s boyfriend Carl, played by wow-I-have-never-seen-him-this-young Liev Schreiber about his novel about the dog and the way she smiles, looks at him, in absolute and pure politeness with “Carl, I’m not an educated woman,” when asked about <em>Master and Margarita</em> or <em>Animal Farm</em> and the “very Kafka-esque” nature of Carl’s novel triggered something primal in me. I have known that look and situation all too well that I knew this movie is for me.
</p>

<div class="paragraph dropcap" >
<p>
Just like a German Shorthaired Pointer would, this film focuses sharply on its core theme and commits in telling the boutique story intimately. All interactions between characters are relatable and poignant. As the film concludes, you build a mental picture of the entire dynamics of this family. At the core of it, I see an extremely overbearing mother, who forced her eldest daughter Eliza, played by Hope Davis—she’s very pretty—into marrying Louis, played by Stanley Tucci—so handsome and I don’t think I’ve seen him this young before—all exploding in unfortunately predictable troubles when a marriage is not built on love.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Rita, the mother, is forcing the same kind of situation onto her youngest daughter Jo, played by Parker Posey—I couldn’t recall what movie I watched with her recently, but it was <a href="../party-girl" title="">Party Girl</a>—where it ends up errupting in flames right back into her (mother’s) face. Carl and Jo are not a good match, since Carl is much more worldly, educated, and curious than Jo and it pisses her off. Not a good combination, if you ask me. Primarily because of this dichotomy in characters, the mother sees him as a “he’s good for her and will take care of her, probably best thing that will ever happen to her” token of luck. Saddest thing of all, Rita is doing it out of good intentions, but we all know that it serves as a great pavement on the road to Hell.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Carl, on the other hand, is just a nice guy with great style. He’s quick on his feet when finding a place for Rita to rest after she’s passed out on the street. He’s harsh but observant on the corruption of American education, morals, and ideals by consumerism-driven impulses and the forces that feed them.
</p>

<div class="paragraph quote" >
<p>
I mean, it’s the fate of the middle class. Everything about middle-class life—you know, cars, suburbs, strip malls, tabloid television—It’s all designed to keep people from having meaningful interactions. The average American knows more about the latest maniac who keeps human heads in their freezer than they do about their own spouse.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph dropcap" >
<p>
On whether it’s a sign of failing democracy and its inevitable decline towards the middle, into mediocrity and that we would be better off in aristocracy because they had more class and “walked into guillotines with class” as Carl notes, that is up for another debate another day. It’s a bit of a redditor take, so Carl has his own wins and fails. But the very heart of his arguments resonates strong and true.

It’s a Christmas afternoon and my eyes are having a hard time focusing on this already zoomed-in text on the screen, which I’ll take as my cue to go and lie down a bit before the feast that my partner’s family have for us. So, to wrap up this quick critique I had for <em>The Daytrippers</em>—it’s a wonderful indie film about the modern America with the kind of people it produces and that you should see it.
