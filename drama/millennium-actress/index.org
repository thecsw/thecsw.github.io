* Millenium Actress
Films are more real than life itself or as someone told me once, ``those who
wander, realize it is in itself a wonder.''

It's much better than I remember first watching it more than a year
ago. Watching more of Japanese cinema in the 40s and 50s gave me a whole level
of appreciation when I connect the story with the wonderful and mesmerizing
Setsuko Hara. I weep like that director filming the documentary.

What an experience it is to live life by breathing through the art of acting,
hence, living someone's else's life. I don't know whether it's the art that
defines life or life that defines art. I would even say that that's a silly
question, as it's an Ouroboros style of action, if allowed to roam freely with
no limits, both of them devour each otherâ€”allowing to reach such heights of
purity in art and soul that give the art of living an indescribable flavor you
simply have to try yourself to appreciate and understand.

Millennium Actress does an incredible job of portraying life through the lens of
art and the importance of art through lived experience. The chase and devotion
to and for the lone artist gave Chiyoko Fujiwara meaning to her struggles,
reason to continue, inspiration to always stay true to herself, which
unfortunately, many of us do lose. The final sequence collapsing her entire life
into a chase of a lifetime is absolutely breathtaking.
