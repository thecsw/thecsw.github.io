* A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter

Until about a week ago I was not aware of Sabrina Carpenter's existence. Sure,
in my vicinity and random places I would hear her songs---they always seemed to
me as ``whatever is popular now'' and I would move on with whatever else I was
doing. She's good! An innuendo Christmas special, where every shot is candy for
the eyes, especially with how fine Sabrina Carpenter looks. I think my favorite
song was /Cindy Lou Who/ and the very last ``fuck'' was funny.
