An aggressively mediocre rendition of the original, quite enjoyable for its
visual effects, yet wholly lacking in anything substantial or even shallow to
say when it comes to its story, message, and legacy. I enjoy thinking about the
Roman Empire as much as the next guy---``Think about the Dream of the Roman
Empire!'' is such a great meme---but this movie felt like a series of scenes and
shots optimized to become viral tiktok reels for years to come.

There isn't much to say. I'm adding it to my list to prove that I do watch
contemporary stuff, but rarely find the energy or desire to write anything
about them. I suppose when they did the GLADIIATOR---that was pretty cool. It's
a good forgettable watch to go to with friends to the movie theaters, especially
after a long work Monday, which was us. Ultimately, it does crush under its own
weight and importance. Surprisingly heavy-handed and treating its viewers as
toddlers who have not seen the first part nor have any idea of what theater they
walked into.

Riddley Scott is scraping the bottom of the barrel that he might have scratched
a hole there---cannot recall any of his recent works that were even passable
when compared to his earlier works. Unimaginative, predictable, and has
absolutely nothing to say nor a leg to stand on. Actors were okay choices. Pity
we didn't get to see more of Pedro Pascal, a wasted opportunity. Denzel
Washington stole the show. I got a free and sick ass poster at my local B&B
theater after the screening, so I felt pretty good. Wouldn't give /Gladiator II/
more than 4.5/10 (the +0.5 is thanks to the poster).
