Exquisitely shot and directed film built on vibes and loneliness. Pure cinema. Having watched <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/drama/in-the-mood-for-love/" title=""><em>In the Mood for Love</em></a> for the tenth+ time—I wanted to experience Wong Kar-Wai’s earlier works and wow this was a pleasant ride. No wonder how it could confuse and puzzle the audiences at first glance. Beyond shallow reasons like having the two (almost) disconnected stories, the core challenge—as I see it— comes in appreciating the film for what it is, rather than what it is not.

This brings up a topic that I love dearly—the age-old discussion of “form” vs “content.” I have written about this distinction plenty enough before (<a href="https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/against-interpretation" title="">https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/against-interpretation</a>)—the gist comes to the modern desire of desecrating works of art by “analyzing” and “interpreting” them into something else, something unintended nor desired; all of this, rather than enjoying them exactly for what they are in the form and shape presented to us. <em>Chungking Express</em> is a perfect case study just for that.

Simply put, it’s pure vibes. It’s erotic. It’s exhilarating. It’s scandalous. It’s unapologetic. It’s impish. It’s daft. It’s relentless. It’s to capture that very special feeling of loneliness. That excruciatingly embarassing, suppressed, shameful, lustfully fulfilling, utterly hopeless rollercoaster of emotions if missing someone, breaking up with them—living in delusions of you two possibly coming back together—against any rational and most probably a good reason on why you split up in the first place—this film captures it all. Something that we won’t tell anybody, not even to ourselves—but we will do it, and do it again, and live it.

It’s a bit of a shame that I don’t actually like <em>California Dreamin&#39;</em>, I prefer their <em>Dream A Little Dream Of Me</em>—this wouldn’t have any effect on my enjoyment of the movie as a whole, though. Big fan of what Wong Kar-Wai is doing here. Big fan of practically founding the shoegaze genre here. Big fan of inventing the archetype of a pixie dream girl. Similar to his later work, the <em>magnum opus</em> of his career—I’ll have to watch <em>Chungking Express</em> a number of times to really warm up to it and see if my heart can welcome it with open arms. Rewatchability on this is insane. God, I love Hong Kong of that era and I’m low-key obsessed with Kowloon Walled City and the Chungking Mansions (the building) is the closest we will get to the glory and the allure of old Hong Kong.
