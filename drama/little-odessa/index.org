* Little Odessa
Surprised that this movie isn't more popular. I saw Tim Roth and forgive me, but
I like Tim Roth; to confess clearly, I stayed through the film for Tim Roth as
well.

I thought it was a fair gangster story; with it being on more melancholic and
slower notes than for example, your usual Scorsese work. The cinematography is
indeed ``KINO.''

Ultimately, not really my styleâ€”but if you are someone who: 1) likes Tim Roth 2)
likes slower and grittier crime films and 3) likes Tim Roth, then this would be
your cup of tea.
