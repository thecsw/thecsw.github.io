Russia's first and greatest poet's last hours.

Alexander Pushkin, colloquially known in Russia as "nashe vse," which roughly
translates to "our everything" is the founder of Russian Literature.

Every writer of the later years, whom I love, think of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,
Gogol, Chekhov, Turgenev, and moreâ€”they all came out of Pushkin's prose.

Phenomenal cast consisting of Alexander Kalyagin playing Zhukovskiy and Irina
Kupchenko taking the role of Vyazemskaya. All in the style of the best Soviet
films that were coming out in the 70s and 80s.

Pushkin was constantly despised by the government as the spokesman for literary
radicals. They killed Pushkin.

Let me go and read Eugene Onegin for the Nth time. Nashe vse.
