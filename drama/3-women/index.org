* 3 Women
Pre-Lynchian nightmare decanted straight out of Robert Altman's mind. I
genuinely hated the first half of the movie---either the mood was not right or I
was too tired or simply not in the space to see it for what it is. The second
half though took me for such a wild spin that the feeling I was left with after
finishing it had haunted me for the next week or so. The absurditiy and terror
of the final twenty to thirty minutes of the story evoke such a strong sense of
flight or fight that I don't have much to say about the plot and many themes
that are covered throughout---you simply have to see it to get that proto
Mulholland Drive experience.
