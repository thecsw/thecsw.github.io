Only after my first Les Blank experience in <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/drama/garlic/" title=""><em>Garlic Is as Good as Ten Mothers</em></a>, I know I wanted more. He has this magical ability to both poke fun at something but do it with such an open heart that it stays right on the fine line of being wholesome, yet witty and satirical, and this is of course, the Americans’ adventures through Europe—with all the modern conveniences of life, like traveling through a dozen countries in just under two weeks—with <em>maybe</em> a day per country according to my rough estimates!
</p>
</div>

<p>
Back then, in the 90s, it might have been the new fashion, I wouldn’t know, since I wasn’t even a thought back then, but, seeing where we are now, even if culturally, it’s a questionable way to <em>really</em> experience a place, but one thing for sure and that is the commercial success of it, because it’s everywhere—ranging from the same “Across-the-Europe” whiplash to the lavish <em>Royal Carribean Cruises</em> taking its guests from one exotic location to another in literally, a blink of an eye!
</p>

I’m of two competing minds on this. Emotionally, as someone who grew up and spent most of his life in Europe and Asia, the idea of swinging by in dozen countries, each rich with its history, food, and people, and then simply “moving on” to the next, without a real space to experience, think, or even think about the place that is getting smaller in the back window of the only-accelerating bus, it robs the traveler of the energy and the magic of being <em>somewhere else</em> that is not <em>what you know</em> nor <em>where you know</em>.

One of my fondest memories is having a random long layover in Frankfurt, it must have been more than sever or eight hours, so, we decided to just leave the airport and go to the old downtown that my sister recommended to me. It’s not that we went to any particular place or had a plan of spots to visit in mind. We simply sat in this one big square with locals and tourists alike, ordered a pint of beer each, and that was it. Read some books. Drew something on a piece of paper. Took a picture of two. Existing in that spot for all these hours, built this connection to the city I’ve never been before and having only seen 0.001% of it—it may be less than that—I’m excited to go back and get to know it a little more.
</p>

Similarly how in the film, <em>Innocents Abroad</em>, they had the museum coordinator who lambasted about tourists back in the day would spend <em>days</em> seeing great works of art, which was barely enough to scratch the surface, and now, having only maybe a couple of hours of non-stop you-need-to-catch-up style of a toure, is there really a point to doing this or is it better not do it all if one can’t do it right? What more important things are there in life, to the human psyche, to the mind and the soul, than experiencing and <em>feeling</em> all the great works of the great people that came before us and all we have today standing on their shoulders?

Les Blank could bring it full circle. The tourists after having returned from their whiplash of an adventure, briefcases full of polaroids and SD cards hot from all the images, they would start reliving the memories—now that they have the time and space to do so—where the time spent <em>over there</em> seems to be stronger through remembering it after the fact than the actual feeling in the moment of being <em>over there</em>. I wouldn’t know which one is better. One that lasts a few moments or forever in memories? They aren’t mutually exclusive, of course, but that seems to be the appeal. Especially, the biggest one, being the convenience of having the entire trip planned and the financial aspect of it covered through agent discounts, etc.

Maybe one day I should try one of those agency programs, could be fun—it possibly could serve as a series of sneak peeks into places to some time later visit for the sake of the place itself.
