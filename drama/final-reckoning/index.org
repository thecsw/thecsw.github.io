* Mission: Impossible -- Final Reckoning

A less compelling story and a package as a whole compared to the previous
installments, nonetheless, still fun to watch and has that MI secret sauce to it
that keeps bringing me seeing it every time in theaters. The threat of AI, how
on the nose, is omnipresent but hard to believe in or feel that something real
is at stake. There is no character to it, not real sense of danger, as the claim
that it as toppling governments and eroding the social fabric—the day to day
life it seems had gone unchanged, while we are led to believe that the nukes are
to strike and wipe out all of humanity.

I have to give it a pass in the whole ``we have exactly 72 hours, not a second
longer nor shorter before it takes control over our nukes.'' How does that work?
Many other movies can get away with it, but from MI, I would have expected
either a plausible reasoning behind it or at the very least, some other scenario
altogether, so it's not looney tunes-esque ``bomb go off we save the world.''
For the sake of the series, enabling a very strong suspense of disbelief—Mission
Impossible: The Final Reckoning is an enjoyable feast of gripping action scenes,
corny dialogue, and Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise.

In a way, I wish to see Tom Cruise in more indie and emotional films, since
looking at his filmography over the past decade, it really is just him playing
the "All American Hero" over and over again in tired franchises. In reverse
order it's Final Reckoning, Dead Reckoning, Maverick, Fallout, American Made,
Mummy, Never Go Back, Rogue Nation. It's good for the dopamine, but that's about
it. This summer flick isn't a rewatch material the slightest, if gripping the
first time, easily boring the very next watch. Overall, I enjoyed the nostalgia
baits and a good company of friends that I went with.
