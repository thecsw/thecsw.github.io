* Crimes of Passion

Watching Crimes of Passion is akin to drinking a concoction made up by mixing
oil and water. The rowdy sex scenes with one helluva smooth tune, a crumbling
marriage with surprising authenticity in its delivery, a dildo killer priest
(absolutely stunning and show-stealing performance by Anthony Perkins), and an
exploration of one's sexuality and dark places it can take.

I don't know, it was such a whiplash watching it middle of the night by myself,
a mix and match of so many different genres in one that kind of clicked, but not
really? However, is it unique and scratch the very specific itch I had for
something of this style? Absolutely.
