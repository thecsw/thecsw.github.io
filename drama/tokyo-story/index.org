What a debilitatingly saddening film. Has the cinema industry as a whole been
able to produce something of this quality, depth, and observational insight into
a human nature anywhere around the modern times? This. This is rightfully one of
the greatest films of all time.

I understand that children and relatives get driven apart as time
goes. Especially when they start their own families—what Noriko told us about
how disappointing life can be (and is). However, much like Kyoko—I couldn't get
the nasty feeling of what all blood relatives (except Kyoko) did wasn't just
cold—it was downright despicable.

Lousy children. It may have been released over 70 years ago, yet the social
critique that Yasujiro Ozu captured here remains the most human, and the most
wrenching as ever. Can't look away for a single moment's time—what if I miss
that single second in the long scene? You can't cut even a single second
away. It's that tight.

The part that locked me in was the part where the Mother was staying at Noriko's
for the night. With the scene of Noriko lying on the floor with her mother
in-law sobbing in the background—surrounded by the total sinking and
somewhat... oil-like darkness of her little apartment. As Martin Scorsese would
say, "Now this is Cinema."

What an overwhelming experience. I'm so happy I go t Criterion's box with all
the supplementals and a commentary with Yasujiro Ozu scholar David
Desser. Beautiful. Call your mother, father, siblings, people you care
about—tell them that you love them. Simple human kindness, the most natural of
its kind has been waning away in 1953—devastatingly so much today.
