* The Life of Chuck
This felt like eating a nice dessert, not too heavy, but light and leaves you
satisfied in the moment. There is a good message of the sheer scale of one's
inner Universe and the absolutely minuscule importance of one's life in the
grand scheme of the surrounding Universe. It's a good contrast shown by the
reverse chronological telling of Chuck's life. Since I also happen to like Tom
Hiddleston a bunch and went it to see the film on my birthday, it was a good
treat for my senses.

The opening part, aka Act 3 had such a powerful mystique to it that all you end
up thinking is "Who the fuck is this Chuck guy" and it delivered on building
that suspense which paid off greatly as the next acts showed the importance of
the first one while recalling the many moments verbatim, which really solidified
the impact they were going for. I haven't read Stephen King's original work, but
the lasting impression of the movie is that it fails to nicely come together,
some disparate parts, but it fails to pulls itself into one big BANG, which is
unfortunate. Loved Act 3 though.

Overall, it was good. I had good musings on some parts of the film with my
friend that I went to see it with—was Chuck satisfied or fulfilled with his
life? Little of it is actually shown except for the basics of being an
accountant and away on a business trip. But if the memory of him dancing is the
only memory that brought him peace on his deathbed, not his wife, not his kid,
or any else—can you say it was worth it, the life he lived or had he not taken a
swing wide and big enough? He would have been a fantastic dancer.

*Update:* I should also say that whatever AMC theater we were in, whenever someone
would open the door or just at random instances, the whole ceiling would start
creaking as if it is about to fall down on all of us. In that attic jumscare
scene, the whole ceiling also started shaking, so it made for a double
effect—hadn't really felt this kind of way in a while. So, whether it was
intended or not—plus one from me since I remember it so vividly.
