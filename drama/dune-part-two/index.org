* Dune: Part Two
What a disappointment. Cartoon villains with psychopathic tendencies in goofy
ass getup trying to be intimidating in a script where writers have decided that
nobody in the audience would be left behind, so they dumbed it down to the
slowest and the least caring audience member to follow along as they scroll
through their endless tiktok feeds featuring Chalamet and Zendaya as both of
them are engaging in an emotionless, hollow, and forced-down-your-throat romance
that bears no meaning of the word but to endlessly convince whoever watching
that they are indeed a dramatic couple in a serious movie that definitely
doesn't have the silliest and laughably over-played tropes that can never find
their rhythm, ending up going either too fast or too slow without connecting the
story as a single whole entityâ€”resulting in an epic only in title, scifi only in
VFX (which were good), and a somewhat believable political commentary only in
writers' wildest ambitions. Go read Foundation instead.
