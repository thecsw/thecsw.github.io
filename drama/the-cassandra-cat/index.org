* The Cassandra Cat
One of the most impressive and unique color gradings I've seen for movies of this era.

I'm always in awe with how good and almost magical a restoration can feel,
especially when done from original negatives and what I imagine, a lot of time
of fixing and cleaning up thousands of instances of dirt, grain, film tears, yet
still keeping that balance of staying true to how the movie was supposed to feel
and look when initially sculpted.

Saw this listed on Criterion Channel as a ``Cat Movie,'' and I don't really
watch a lot of Czech movies in the wild—seemed like a perfect match after a long
Thursday. And you know what. It was so good! I liked the social commentary at
heart, with revealing the people's true identities, painting their whole bodies
as either liars (violet), cheaters (yellow), thieves (gray), and in loveee
(red). The cat needs to look at someone for them to get colored.

It felt somewhat similar to the play, ``The Star Without a Name'' from 1944 by
Mihail Sebastian and later its Soviet adaptation, [[https://sandyuraz.com/writings/nameless_star/][``The Nameless Star,'']] directed
by Mikhail Kozakov, starring Igor Kostolevsky as Marin Miroiu and Anastasiya
Vertinskaya as Mona (totally go see it if you haven't). The provincial town
lifestyle, of everyone constantly in each others' businesses. Speaking of Mona,
one of the reasons I noticed the movie is just by how drop-dead stunningly
coma-inducing ethereally soft gorgeous Emília Vášáryová is as Diana.

Last but not least, I should make a full circle and praise the colors and how
really, revolutionary it is at that time to go and paint entire sequences in
solid colors, as if we were watching a theater play. Overall, I enjoyed it very
much, probably given to the general comedic and at the same time, observational
nature of the film!
