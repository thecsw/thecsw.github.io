* Boogie Nights
There is no Mark Walberg before this---not without his massive /Pulp
Fiction/-esque organ hanging in between his legs that got everyone mesmerized to
the point of losing themselves in this plot full of lust, desire, danger, money,
and greed---all the greatest things that the 70s is remembered by. Oh, and yes,
the adult industry with the overflowing production of pornography is to
remembered by everyone who lived in that time, because the quality today is too
good compared to what---VHSs on a tiny screen in the family living room?
