* Flowers of Shanghai

This felt more like a theater or a play than a film. Walking from one room to
another only to witness personal tragedies of our characters unfolding one after
another in rapid succession. There isn't much to say, as all we have done is get
but a glimpse into those lives, almost as an idle passerby. Ultimately, nothing
happens, just life; and we leave them to it as if we were never here.
