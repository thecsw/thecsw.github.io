<em>Minecraft Movie</em> is probably one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. It’s just straight-up bad, man. I studied films in college, took classes, even did a whole graduate-level course on trash films like <em>Asylum</em>, John Waters, Sharknado, etc., but they all had a charm to eat—they were campy, they had <em>something</em> to say, they tried so desperately to be something that they weren’t resulting in a product that genuine. <em>Minecraft Movie</em> is the polar opposite of it all, as it lacks any kind of substance, soul, purpose, and worst of all, for its kind, it lacks entertainment.

When thinking of what to give this movie on my made-up scale of “goodness,” I thought to myself that giving it two out of five is a solid mark, since the end product, that is, a <em>primarily</em> and <em>only</em> a <em>commercial</em> product, is mediocre to its core. Unfortunately, I had found an <em>Extras</em> tab in my HBO app, which presented a 15-minute long documentary on the making of the movie. I’m always here for a good documentary and behind-the-scenes scoop, which usually gives me more appreciation for the production side of things.

I am sad to report that my respect for the creators and whoever had the final say had deteriorated to levels hard to imagine. Seeing all the work that had been poured into the project, ranging from inviting seasoned game veterans to building real-life props and iterating on them for many months to find that perfect representation for them—only for all of that effort to go unnoticed and essentially, ignored.

I wouldn’t leave you without an example. In the scene of Steve’s secret dungeon, where the characters would build their weapons and stuff, the documentary showed how each shelf was stacked with unique items from all over the game, built with care and love, full of references to any corners of the game. The final movie cut glanced over all of it, only to focus our attention on the boy making his tater tot gun, promptly leading the whole squad leaving the building pronto.

<p>
In that time, one should ask themselves, “what was the point of all the prop work?” Worst of all, whenever it <em>did</em> appear for a split second in the background, I was fully convinced it was green screened, so I have disregarded it mentally almost immediately. In contrary, imagine when they were just about to enter the scene of the secret stash, we had a few camera angles from different shooting spots of the shelves and interior, giving us appreciation not only for the production designers’ efforts, but in the story, for how well-traveled Steve really is, since he was able to collect all of the rare loot and items that gamers could appreciate.

<p>
It is getting the lowest possible rating from me for the totally missing the mark in making the movie <em>even</em> entertaining and wasting the potential they had for free with the IP and stafff assigned.
