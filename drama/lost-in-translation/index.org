* Lost in Translation
My office has a monitor that plays Sofia Coppola's /Lost in Translation/
around-the-clock every day---I never get tired seeing it throughout the day,
watching it while doing my chores, thinking about it randomly, or feeling it
when I need it the most---that about sums up my relationship with this
film. Roger Ebert said it perfectly.
