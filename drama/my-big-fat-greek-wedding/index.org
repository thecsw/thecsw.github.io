* My Big Fat Greek Wedding
Watched this a few days after I got married---it's got that charm of the 90s and
early 2000s cinema. A little dose of this and that in here and it makes for a
movie to be enjoyed with the whole family. Exaggerated stereotypes, though some,
frighteningly relatable---/My Big Fat Greek Wedding/ is a treasure trove of
one-liners, catch-phrases, and references that I can throw at any occasion.
