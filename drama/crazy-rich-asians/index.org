* Crazy Rich Asians
Qualifies as a comfort film. It's inoffensive, pretty fun, shot nicely with
little notes---whenever I stay at a hotel somewhere, I've developed this habit
of just turning this in the background as an ignorable noise, so the
TV keeps playing something and gives that missing illumination, since the hotel
rooms seldom ever have any light sources that are more powerful than a bed night
light or a lamp on its dying breath.

I always thought the second half of the movie is a little weaker than the first
half---since the whole story starts with a nice pace of them chatting at an NYC
cafe, where every person in South Korea gets to learn about it in a span of
a minute or two. It's a fun interpretation of the nouveau rich phenomena in
Singapore and similar stories---played to the extreme, which makes it fun!
Nothing more to say.
