<em>The Brutalist</em> with Adrian Brody left a mix of conflicting feelings—not the kinds that make you think, but the kinds that make you forget you have ever even seen the movie two days after the fact, which is me right now at night in the kitchen with nothing more than a paper and a pen; finally, decided to jot down a note or tow of what I thought.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
The exquisite parts are the usual suspects, like <em>Vistavision</em> format and the actors, namely Adrian Brody and Guy Pierce. The most enjoyable 90 minutes in a movie theater this year and it’s only been a month. The whole first arc was nothing short of greatness in composition, writing, and execution through acting. But anything after that was such a brutal miss that it left me wondering whether <em>The Brutalist</em> stands for how sharp of a nosedive the film would take after leaving its intermission. This was the bad part.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
The bad part is in how heavy-handed the writing and story turned out to be, as if the muse guiding them from the beginning has left the premises of the writers’ room to never be heard back from ever again. I just don’t understand. With a sharp story, gorgeous cinematography, and a compelling structure of it all—it should have been a slam dunk.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
The heavy handedness of business owners literally “owning” the person. The not-so-subtle-eat-the-rich caricature-esque mission to drill into the audience’s mind; really, out of nowhere, as if completely out of ideas—the final twist delivered absolutely nothing and only alienated the film from its strong core it already wasted halfway through its second act. The suspense was gone, as so any subtlety
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
<em>The Brutalist</em> was doing well at the start. The latter kind of nothing-burger “artsy” shots of postmodernist buildings have solidified my theory of their muse abandoning them even stronger.The final nail in the coffin was the hammer of the “generational message.” The director didn’t just make a mis-step or a snafu. The second half opened my eyes to it. <em>The Brutalist</em> feels more of a director’s argument that if he shows us serious, intellectual things, shows us that he thinks of serious and intellectual thoughts, then he of course himself must be a serious and an intellectual being.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
When I view it from this lens now—it all makes sense. The north star was not creating a great film, but to for us to regard him as a great director. The two, of course, being things that are far from each other. Formally speaking, the camerawork is excellent. Two leads’ acting is strong. The setting of the time and place is intriguing and a lot of opportunity to work out from different angles. Utterly ruined by misplaced time and energy feeding one’s ego than to what they are creating. This is the ugly part of the experience. I had a great time though. Went with my buddy, had a whole Panera Chicken Pesto sandwich, double g&amp;t, long island iced tea, and a double shot cognac and soda.
