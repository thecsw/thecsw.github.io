A bit of a tough watch if experienced in its original form. In the style of its
prose, it was more of Tolstoy's moral lecturing than what I feel closer to, which
is Dostoevskyian priest, Father Zosima from /Brothers Karamazov/. Beautifully shot
and masterfully acted by Pyotr Mamonov, who himself has walked the path of
enhancing one's faith. Some moments are heavy-handed as the purpose of what is
happening on the screen is already perfectly clear and instead, the telling
lacks a certain heart and warmth I would want to see from a telling of a
religious repentance.
