* One Battle After Another
Man. What a ride.

This is an epic tale of love, betrayal, loss, loyalty, mission, and consequences
that come with each. The sheer scale of the story told is one to behold. From
the moment it started, on a sensitive topic of today---it had not let me go from
its tight grip not even for a moment's time. The music, the cinematography, the
separation of the events to the ``dangerous fast-moving past, almost a glimpse
into who they used to be'' vs. ``the aftermath of being domestic terrorists and
meeting the wrath of militarized violence.'' I'm impressed by the idea, courage
to chase it, and the discipline to execute it with precision.

Sean Penn was fucking terrifying. One of my favorite Leonardo DiCaprio roles,
he's exactly where he thrives. Everyone is after power for the sake of having
it. Without retelling any part of the film, keep the fighting spirit living on.
