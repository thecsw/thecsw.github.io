* Dune
It was fine. Frank Herbert was never near and dear to me as Isaac Asimov was, so
that's my relationship with the book, but I stayed open-minded for the movie to
treat them with separate hearts. Overall, I could not make myself care about the
family dynamics, the emotional context, and the plot in general, which at times
presents itself so seriously with constant close shots of everyone's faces that
it simply becomes silly.

Action scenes are great and the costumes are top-notch. But this film is like
butter, there is just nothing to hold on to mentally. I'm thinking of what to
say and there is very little that comes to me. It's not an average
run-of-the-mill scifi, you can tell; you could also tell that the second part is
where it really counts, so I'm excited to see it through.
