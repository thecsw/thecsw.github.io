I was talking to [[https://letterboxd.com/tryavna/][Quiller]] on [[https://letterboxd.com/tryavna/film/rose-hobart/][Letterboxd]] and the closing thoughts of his review,

Ultimately, then, it’s a surrealist’s assertion that the process of watching and
finding meaning in movies is akin to the process of dreaming and interpreting
those dreams. It’s a one-of-kind masterpiece.

Stuck with me and I’ve been thinking about it for a while. I first watched Rose
Hobart in college for my film class—being of that age, it connected to me, but I
was not able to articulate of what it meant.

Yet somehow, I religiously watch it every half a year or so, and as you put—I
would even say, it’s an intimate relationship that’s being built between the
audience member and the work itself.

/Rose Hobart/ is the love of montage (thanks, Eisenstein and [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/cameraman/][Vertov]]), the love of
a movie star, more of a muse (Cornell was harmless, it was more of an adoration,
_not_ the kind Satoshi Kon depicted in [[../perfect-blue][Perfect Blue]], heh), and the love of his own
vision.

Something many artists and filmmakers struggle with—how do you hear and
understand your inner-self to the point of articulating it? David Lynch may be
one of the most prominent speakers on this.

Watching /Rose Hobart/ for the first time, just blindly without any background
would be a bit tough. I wouldn't even blame anyone for clicking away after the
first couple of seconds in stupor and confusion of what they just saw.

Exactly—it's one of those works that don't over-chew the food before feeding
you, leaving you enough space and room to breathe and make up your mind,
whatever it may be. So many films nowadays leave you with nothing left to
say—*not* because they were ``breathtaking'' or ``speechless'' in any good way, but
simply, ``it exhausted itself.''

Of course, it's not about the length either. You can have a very very long work,
think of /War and Peace/ by Tolstoy and [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/bk/][/Brothers Karamazov/]] by Dostoevsky—they
say A LOT, but there is much more left to be said and articulated by the reader
himself. /Rose Hobart/ is similar. It says so little, because it doesn't have
you. You come to it yourself.

There is a sense of pleasure and satisfaction to be derived from learning how to
enjoy these ``original'' kinds of works. Not in any elitist or "who knows, knows"
way—but very much of really, training your perception. Joseph Cornell was
himself a part of a big underground film scene, so the elitist tendencies that
some might find in people enjoying these ``obscure'' works are truly
unfounded. Maybe only founded in the lack of context and true interest.

The coolest thing is that you can go and watch /Rose Hobart/ straight on YouTube,
