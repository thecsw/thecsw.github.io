I was a little surprised to see the movie that I had just seen airing in my local movie theaters to get mentioned as a new <em>Criterion</em> physical release in one of their emails I get every now and then. Having a fresh movie off the press like that getting a physical copy must serve as some sort of a strong-ish signal of its relative quality. Especially with all the buzz from its numerous awards and nominations, I realized there is no better way to experience it than on my eight hour long flight from Chicago to Frankfurt in Boeing B747-8’s Economy Class.

Having had a chance to reflect on <em>Anora</em> over the past month or so, I think it’s pretty alright. The one scene that I think about is where the glamour of her life in the club is sharply contrasted with her walking back home early in the morning wearing a persona so different from what we have seen before. The abundance of “raw” scenes involving sex, screaming, layered dialogues, etc. lost their allure the more they threw them at my face. The whole chase scene with Armenians and Russians was more appropriate for a Scooby-Doo episode, since losing their momentum they had in the beginning, they lost the point that got me hooked in the beginning.
