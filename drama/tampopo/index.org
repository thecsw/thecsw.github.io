A +spaghetti+ *ramen* western set in Japan! Surprisingly enough, /Tampopo/ is made of
even finer stuff than its original American counterparts that it is so
skillfully playing off of. Every element ranging from the main storyline of a
lone truck driver guiding a woman with her failing noodle shop through the art
and business of ramen business---to all the wonderful vignettes capturing the
soul of being human through the lens of how we interact with food.

It really is a perfect film. There really isn't anything to add and more
importantly, nor is there anything to shave off. I vaguely remembering watching
it when I was a tiny boy, who knows when---it has that way of making you feel at
home. Whether it be with a great cast of characters, wholesome story, uplifting
music, or a combination of all of those.

Go enjoy and appreciate some good ramen out there!\
