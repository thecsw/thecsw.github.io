A <s>spaghetti</s> <strong>ramen</strong> western set in Japan! Surprisingly enough, <em>Tampopo</em> is made of even finer stuff than its original American counterparts that it is so skillfully playing off of. Every element ranging from the main storyline of a lone truck driver guiding a woman with her failing noodle shop through the art and business of ramen business—to all the wonderful vignettes capturing the soul of being human through the lens of how we interact with food.

It really is a perfect film. There really isn’t anything to add and more importantly, nor is there anything to shave off. I vaguely remembering watching it when I was a tiny boy, who knows when—it has that way of making you feel at home. Whether it be with a great cast of characters, wholesome story, uplifting music, or a combination of all of those.

<strong>January 1st, 2025</strong><br>What a better film to follow up after <em>In the Mood for Love</em> with family during the winter holidays? Tampopo! Ah, what a wonderful ramen western. It’s cozy, wholesome, and has a special way of saying what it wants to. The little stories told through bizarre vignettes and multiplexed with a cute ramen western story—all united through every hero’s absolute love and desire for good food. I need to watch the bazillion extras that Criterion has. Our grandpa is a huge fan that just found out about the rabbit hole that Criterion Channel is with their extras—the future is bright. Happy 2025!

<strong>February 20th, 2025</strong><br>Wonderful vibes. There is a popup event in my city, where a local ramen shop had flown in ramen chefs from Japan to come and cook at their location for a week or so. I got tickets for all of my friends, a large group of eight of us to go and try peak ramen.

One of the beefs we had with one of our friends is that they would never finish their ramen on our previous visits. It sat particularly wrong with my partner. So, right before driving out to the ramen place, we had a watch party, where the film was perfectly long enough for us to dart off the moment it was over.
</p>

<p>
It gave our friends a deeper appreciation for the craft and the one in question did in fact finish his entire bowl that very evening. Teaching the gospels of ramen one popup event at a time.
