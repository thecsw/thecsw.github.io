I'm lost for words. The supreme summit of filmmaking and taking the creation of
art as one of the most serious embarks on can do.

There is nothing left to say. For the overwhelming majority of cases, we really
lost the sense of how to create something like High and Low; the audiences might
have forgotten how to watch it.

Phenomenal. I never use this word, as using it many times cheapens its
value. Nonetheless. Phenomenal.
