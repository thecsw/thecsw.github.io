Bubble gum with the flavor of ``/The Devil Wears Prada/'' and I love ``/The Devil
Wears Prada./'' The whole movie with its plot walks like a duck, looks like a
duck, and quacks like a duck, where the duck in this hypothetical scenario is an
A24 product. Has its charm and wit; can't forget about the fucking gorgeous
cinematography and scenes that truly stand out---I'm thinking of the dinner scene.

Like bubble gum, it loses its flavor quick, turning into a tasteless mush, but
you can still recall that raspberry flavor it had just a few minutes
before. Nothing much, if anything stands out a few days after the initial
watch---except, of course, the dinner scene---overall, it's a good movie, not
bad, not great, and easily better than most of the slop being produced today.
