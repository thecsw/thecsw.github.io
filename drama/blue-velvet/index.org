I have some sort of a personal connection to /Blue Velvet/ and really, a story of
how I first learned about /Criterion/ and the trained virtue of respecting
films. It was some time of Spring 2019 or Fall of 2019. A high time of me
running around with whatever a freshman and sophomore worries about---grades,
relationships, and wanting to get more sleep.

I remember it distinctly. The room of my advisor. We will call him N.N., the great gentleman, so to
preserve his privacy. He was and still is the biggest movie enjoyer I
know. Anything. Ask him about /Pink Flamingos/, /Divine/, /The Asylum/, /Sleazoid
Express/, /Something Weird Video/, /Bloody Pit of Horror/, and I shudder at thought
of what the actual list would be like. He knows it all.

Thanks to him, I took the [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/good_bad_movies/][Trash Cinema course]] during my first semester of
college, which set me on the bright path that I followed ever since. One day at
his office, after a semester of our active bonding---he told me with all the
excitement in the world how much he's waiting for Criterion's /Blue Velvet/ to
come out at the end of May in 2019.

I have heard of /Blue Velvet/ because /Twin Peaks/ is my favorite show---I've done a
great disservice to David lynch by never seeing his film. A while after, I
finally watched /Blue Velvet/ on my little laptop screen in the middle of my dorm
bedroom on my bunk bed. Let me make my confession---I did not understand what I
really saw. The topics of the evil lurking beneath and how our environment
corrupts were some of the big points I understood.

As time went on, almost 5 years later---I decided to give it a watch again. Of
course, I got the /Criterion/'s [[https://www.criterion.com/films/29144-blue-velvet][edition]], so I can enjoy the newly restored
picture, better audia, and *all* of the original extra documentaries and special
edition features. The 120 minute runtime just went by like /this/. I wonder how
many graduate papers were written and in how many film programs is /Blue Velvet/
included as a required part of their curriculum.

The idea of /Blue Velvet/ and not to over-analyze David Lynch's work as well---you
have to feel it through, the idea that I see holds up just as it did from way
back then. There is a great deal of mystery, evil, and potential for corruption
within all of us. Who can truly know the true underbelly of the idyllic America
we built with all the shiny bright colors---suffering a severe case of
schizophrenia---the grand delusion with a mammoth lie at its core, which we all
believe in so sheepishly like some complicit livestock.

Is what one says while living in fear of their carefully-constructed personas
leaking the black goo, which oozes from the subconscious mind. There is some
message, yet again, like in Akira Kurosawa's [[../high-and-low][/High and Low/]] and Dostoevksy's
[[https://sandyuraz.com/writings/ideal_love/][/Brothers Karamazov/]]. More of a thought that in truth---we are all brothers,
fundamentally carrying responsibility for one another, as we are humans---none
of us live in isolation. To impact and affect someone is the biggest action of
an immoral action that one can partake in. Recall Lord Henry,

#+begin_quote
“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is
immoral-immoral from the scientific point of view.”\
“Why?”\
“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does not think
his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not
real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He
becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been
written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature
perfectly—that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves
nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes
to one’s self. [...]''

Somehow, deep down---American Dream of suburbia always felt /insanely/ dystopian
in a malevolent kind of way. This is not paranoia or ``seeing things through
projecting''. Can you not feel it? Can you not feel how hollow that dream is?
/It's a strange world, isn't?/
