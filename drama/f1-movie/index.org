* F1
It would be hard to imagine a movie that is more formulaic and predictable than
/F1: The Movie/, yet retains its /Top Gun/-style charm led by Brad Pitt's affable
performance and the story so inoffensive and straightforward that the total
experience, albeit forgettable, is a positive one. The entire setup of our hero
being a nomad guy who does it not for the fame and glory (anymore), but for the
sake of driving of in itself. Writing this after watching it a month or so ago, I
can't recall that much in terms of details or anything that stood out to
me---perhaps, it left the same aftertaste in my mouth as /Cars 3/, with the young
beating the old with the new tech and gadgets, but the old besting them in lived
experience.
