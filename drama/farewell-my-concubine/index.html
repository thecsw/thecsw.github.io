Mesmerizing, breathtaking, and ruthless in slicing your heart into the tiniest of pieces. What would the changing political and cultural landscape do to the bond between two brothers‚Äîstressed to its limit with jealousy and betrayal? <em>Farewell My Concubine</em> is a testament to the ideals that every film, director, writer should strive to reach for, or, at the very least, be intimately aware of. Similar to what I think of <em>In the Mood for Love</em>, this is a perfect film, where you cannot add nor subtract anything, otherwise, it would not be itself.

I don‚Äôt know where to start. Words had a difficult time forming in my head, where I could put them in writing here later. Leslie Cheung is one of a kind. Nobody else could do this role. As he not only played Dieyi, but he played Dieyi playing Lady Yu, the concubine, with such faith and tenderness, I have truly forgotten I was watching a film, an actor at work altogether. Wow. Not often something affects me to such an extent, where I would shed a tear or have goosebumps springing up all over my back.

To present the truth, I am not much familiar with Beijing opera, nor with classical Chinese opera either, so seeing the decorations, the setup, costumes, singing, acting, and luxuriously heavy makeup in the beginning of the film had alienated me just a bit with how extravagant and exotic it felt. It was more of a puzzled excitement that developed later into a playful curiosity and findings its branches growing into the realm of sincere adoration. As the characters, politics, and culture of China changed, so have I through the three hour long runtime of <em>Farewell My Concubine</em>.

The training that Shitou and Douzi had to go through was absolutely brutal, but ultimately, unsurprising for the times, place, and discipline. It is the expectation that honoring traditions comes above all else, at the expense of one‚Äôs self-expression, individuality, or life. Not to say I agree with it, but I do understand. My younger sister went through more of a decade of classical Piano training, where the teacher who had learned the art through similar ways in her youth, has bestowed‚Äîalbeit, modernized and softer ways‚Äîsimilar methodologies during my sister‚Äôs lessons.

I would be lying if I said there wasn‚Äôt something to it. There really is, otherwise, history wouldn‚Äôt have played out this way. To reach such pinnacle and perfection of art, one must endure a great sacrifice endured through a series of personal tragedies. It‚Äôs not written anywhere, but nobody can escape the reality of it either. Similar how the greatest artists of the past, think of Renaissance era, breathed and lived through the lens of their discipline, art, from a young age‚Äîas this was the rule when masters of the time would take them away from their parents and families, such that the training can start as soon as possible.

Leslie Cheung, again, otherwordly, similar ethereal presence and quality of Maggie Cheung, expressed this way of living through art like none other. As the times change, the audiences change, Dieyi continues living in opera, which for him, is no different than every day life, in sharp contrast to Xiaolou, who built a great wall between opera and everything else. We see how their relationship evolves and devolves even more, as they get taken advantage of, harassed, assaulted, raped, ridiculed, and prosecuted. When the Cultural Revolution came, not much has changed, really, the violence was still present, the Red Guard did not hold everyone as right and equal, as Juxian‚Äôs past as a prostitute drove her story to a crisis, as the only way to deal with counterrevolutionaries is to hang and execute them, as prosecutions and interrogations continued and intensified‚Äînothing and everything was changing at the same time.

<p>
While everybody got swept up in the great tides of the revolution, art, the ideals and essence of Beijing opera was the only constant, ever so faint that could ground Dieyi and Xiaolou. Their movements, songs, costumes, makeup, the opera <em>Farewell My Concubine</em>‚Äîfundamentally, it has not changed, as the very core of it is forever eternal. Only through their last performance, do we see Dieyi owning his role in the great act to the very end, we see him pushing art to the limits, where only action is powerful enough to convey the meaning.
