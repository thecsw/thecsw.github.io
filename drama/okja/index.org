Highly recommended to me by my partner and what an interesting film this is. The
message and purpose is so loud and clear that stating it would be nothing short
of superfluous.

It's good. Very good. Even more, I'm reassured of our decision not to eat pork,
as they are so genetically close to humans (you can put a pig's heart in a
human) that eating them could be considered akin to eating one of our own kind
(not good).

I much enjoyed the beginning of the movie of showing how Okja spent her days in
the wild and the whole showcasing of what a psycho Jake Gyllenhaal is (his
character was quite extreme).

However, I do feel the second half of the film dragged on a bit with a
superhero-esque turns of fate, very much, how would I say... pompous? For
something of this sort, I expected or wanted it go deeper into exploration of
relationship we have with our animal brothers.

Something more hard-hitting than what felt like an over-trivilazation of the
story to make it more digestable if we add more goofy characters, deus ex
machinas, and an elite secret society of animal lovers. Not to say comedy isn't
needed, it lacked some of the gut punch I was hoping it to deliver (the finale
does it somewhat well).
