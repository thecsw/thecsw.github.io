My partner’s entire family has shocked me because they have never seen <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em>. With this being a chill Christmas Day’s evening, knowing what everyone’s tastes are like—I had no choice but to recommend this timeless classic. To my delight, it is as good as I have always remembered it to be. The cast, the music, the story, how pathetic Ed Rooney was, how cool Ferris is, how charming Sloane is, an what a great character arc Cameron goes through—starting off as a (truly) sickly kid, depressed, in fear of his parents, especially the dad, to someone who has made a decision to stand up to him for once in his life.
</p>

<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
Wonderful. It is no secret that Cameron is the core protagonist of the film, as he is the one that goes through a real transformation; everybody else kind of stays static—with a small exception of Ferris’ sister. God, Charlie Sheen looks so fine in that ghostly makeup. My partner may have not liked him, but I think he is the epitome of a hot troublesome guy. But, I digress. Bringing us back to the narrative, let’s talk about Ferris Bueller himself.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
When I first saw the movie and this must have been a decade or two ago—I remember how I took him as my role model. Not to some crazy or obsessive extent, but I would think to myself, especially in early high school—“how would Ferris Bueller deal with this situation and get out of it spotless?” I kid you not, it has gotten me out of a pickle and a number of awkward situations unscathed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" >
<p>
I see around the sentiment that he’s the asshole or the antagonist of the story—my partner said the same. To the extent that he is ruining lives of the people around him and doesn’t take their feelings into consideration whenever he’s proposing to do anything. Or maybe, Ferris Bueller simply reminds them of somebody they used to know. Some harsh criticism I found <a href="https://boxd.it/1aN5N" title="">on letterboxd</a> goes as far as to call him “one of the most obnoxious, self-centered, egotistical, douchy, horrendous, repulsive, selfish, vile, repugnant, greedy, narcissistic, uncaring, and hideous characters ever in the history of film.“
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph dropcap" >
<p>
That is crazy to me. This review right next to some perfect score post saying it’s the best thing since sliced bread. I understand where the criticism comes from and let me just say fuck off lol. The misreading that some can do is truly baffling. The whole point is that Ferris gets Cameron <em>out of his shell</em>, getting him to explore the wider world, muster up the courage to finally stand up for himself, to his father, to rebel against his parents (who hate each other) on why do they not love him as much as they do themselves or random material possessions like a sports car.
</p>

<p>
In total honesty, when somebody complains about Ferris Bueller as being the bully and/or “ruining lives around him” are either projecting some real bad experiences and people they had in their own lives onto the movie or they have never lived or have this mediocre desire to feel special by bashing onto an archetype, which they have not attempted to understand or try to extract the positives out of onto their own day to day lives. It’s really ironic and laughable (browsing them haters’ top films—I know we would not get along.)

<p>
Well, we shouldn’t spend too much time talking about the meek and gullible. I mean, <em>life moves pretty fast—if you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.</em> If you have never seen this film, go watch it! It’s what I would consider to be a <em>perfect movie</em>. Nothing to take out of it and nothing to add to it either. Go commandeer a float and sing your heart out. Go spoof a restaurant reservation. Go encourage your friend to see how full life can feel. Go smooch your partner. Go marry your partner. Go skip school and do something you are actually interested in (my entire year of college).
