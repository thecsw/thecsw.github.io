Good movie just right for the Christmas spirit. Could very well be a new
addition to many people's yearly catalogue of Winter movies.

I love Paul Giamatti and it was personally great seeing him since my last
rewatch of /Sideways/ and him playing Chuck Rhoades in /Billions/.

Warm story wrapped up in a cozy atmosphere about people being people. My high
school principal from years ago would have done the very same, I feel.
