WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR!

I couldn't believe my ears when one of my closest friends told me he has never
seen Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Just, Scott Pilgrim
anything. Blew. My. Mind. Isn't that like borderline illegal, especially if you
are a millennial or an older Gen Z? I knew that I had to fix him.

We drove to the closest Barnes & Noble. I found a $4 DVD box for Scott Pilgrim
vs. The World; on our drive back home, I was so excited to start the educational
session on the anatomy of a good movie. Punch the disc into my bluray player,
turn off the lights, turn on the project, and build that ``Somehow, heartbreak
feels good in a place like this'' atmosphere that Nicole Kidman can't stop
talking about every time you step foot in an ACM theater.

About two hours later—we were weeping. What a class act
masterpiece. Ramona..... if you can't find yourself someone like Ramon—why even
try? The DVD I got also had a bunch of deleted footage, bloopers, and
cast/director commentaries over the film reel. I NEVER knew that the original
ending (called ``alternate'' in the DVD) was that Ramon leaves and Scott gets back
together with Knives when she turns 18 in the final fight against Gideon. It
felt so... wrong. More emotionally mature and overall adult? sure. But NOT IN MY
UNITED STATES OF WHATEVER.

What a charm. From the deleted scenes, I learned that Ramona apparently
smokes. She is so cool. Like, fr fr, all we would chant together through the
film was ``she is so cool.'' But you know who is as cool? Wallace Wells. Now
that. The peak man, right here. I was flabbergasted when I learned that Kieren
Culkin wasn't actually gay. Now that was one kind of a whiplash. Lucas Lee is
Chris Evans' finest role. ``I wanna have his adopted babies.'' Touché Wallace,
touché. I'd also watch all of Lucas Lee's movies, like /Let's Hope there is a
Heaven/ or /Thrilled to be Here./

The bloopers, documentaries, and commentaries I watched all indicate very
strongly of how much respect and love all the actors, the cast, and the staff
have for Edgar Wright (not unexpected). It's rare to find a movie that is
enjoyed as much by the actors as does the audience. Crazy that they are
apparently on the same email chain since 2009 and all have responded within
three hours when asked to reprise their role in the anime adaptation.

I wanted to give it 9/10 only because I think the recent anime, Scott Pilgrim
Takes Off is EVEN better than the movie in some aspects (more Ramona and
development, better suited medium)—it just DOES NOT feel right. Ramona is so
cool. Wallace is so cool. Lucas Lee is so cool. Perfect film. 10/10. They really
don't make 'em like they used to.
