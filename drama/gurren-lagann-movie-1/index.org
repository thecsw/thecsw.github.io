* Gurren Lagann the Movie: Childhood’s End
Went to the movie theater, which was rolling this classic. This
masterpiece. This absolute magnum opus of anime as a form of art.

They really don't make anything like this anymore. Masculinity did not exist
before Gurren Lagann. If I ever could be the half of a man that Kamina is—I
would be quite a man.

It was great seeing Hiroyuki Imaishi giving an intro to the movie in theaters
for the series' 15th anniversary. The whole theater was packed with eight true
diggers.

We even all took a picture doing a Kamina pose to commemorate TTGL. "Same time
next week?—Absolutely."
