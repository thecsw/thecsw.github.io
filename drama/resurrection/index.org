* Resurrection
Here I am weeping with chills running down my spine with the tearducks
overflowing with my salty tears, yet I hold myself back from wiping off in fear
I could miss even a single frame of this film that I had just seen two days
ago---it wanted me back.

/Resurrection/ is an experience to... experience. To only enjoy on the big screen
surrounded with other audience members' aura and souls, which would only boost
the pleasure and satisfaction so much more. And the snores... the snoring is
what gets me. I weep and I weep.

This is a story of being lost, punished, searching for wisdom, only through and
by helping others, finding love and salvation. But you know, I don't care that
much for all the in-between-the-lines and boring analysis one would make about
``how great cinema is''---/Resurrection/ is a pleasure to the sensory and within.
