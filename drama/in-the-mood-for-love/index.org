Now this is Cinema.

Maman asked me to see it—feelings that are truly, one of a kind. Specially woke
up around 6am to see it in the quiet darkness by myself before the day kicks
in. Today was a good day.

There isn't much I can say—what are my words even worth when trying to describe
this masterpiece with so-called ``words.'' Sometimes, even a trained skill of
articulation would fail you if it were never meant to be the right tool to
communicate non-verbal nuances like Wong Kar-wai does in his
picture. Love. Lust. Desire. 

I have a massive weak spot for the Hong Kong and Kowloon-esque style of
everything from the 1960s. ``Kowloon Generic Romance'' is a manga series that
capitalizes on this as well. Let me tell you, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung look
stunningly gorgeous. You hear me. Stunningly. Gorgeous. My vocabulary had a
short circuit throughout the film and the only coherent thought I could murmur
out, /``stunningly... gorgeous...''/

I'm thoroughly convinced that they do not make people like this. It is something
truly beyond. You know cinema when you see it, as they say.

Whenever the entirety of human race is long extinct, close to nil of anything
remaining that proves our existence but ashes and dust of what was once great—I
wish this picture perseveres through time, such that whoever finds it after
we're far gone can see that we did at once exist and lived to the standards of
what makes us human in the first place.
