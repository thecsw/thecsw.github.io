* In the Mood for Love
Now this is Cinema.

Maman asked me to see it—feelings that are truly, one of a kind. Specially woke
up around 6am to see it in the quiet darkness by myself before the day kicks
in. Today was a good day.

There isn't much I can say—what are my words even worth when trying to describe
this masterpiece with so-called ``words.'' Sometimes, even a trained skill of
articulation would fail you if it were never meant to be the right tool to
communicate non-verbal nuances like Wong Kar-wai does in his
picture. Love. Lust. Desire. 

I have a massive weak spot for the Hong Kong and Kowloon-esque style of
everything from the 1960s. ``Kowloon Generic Romance'' is a manga series that
capitalizes on this as well. Let me tell you, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung look
stunningly gorgeous. You hear me. Stunningly. Gorgeous. My vocabulary had a
short circuit throughout the film and the only coherent thought I could murmur
out, /``stunningly... gorgeous...''/

I'm thoroughly convinced that they do not make people like this. It is something
truly beyond. You know cinema when you see it, as they say.

Whenever the entirety of human race is long extinct, close to nil of anything
remaining that proves our existence but ashes and dust of what was once great—I
wish this picture perseveres through time, such that whoever finds it after
we're far gone can see that we did at once exist and lived to the standards of
what makes us human in the first place.

Introducing this film to my partner's grandpa---what a real treat. Yet again,
/In the Mood for Love/ is an all-time masterpiece. Absolute magnum opus of what
cinema should strive to be. An experimentation with art and style to such an
extreme extent that the end product results in something so wholly unique that
it captures the hearts of millions throughout all time.

Watching /In the Mood for Love/ again four days later to introduce it to my
partner's sister. God. What a beauty. I've seen this film so many times already,
yet every time, there are a few moments, where without even really consciously
thinking on anything---I get such a jolt of electricity throughout my body,
goosebumps on my back, and tears involuntarily leaving my tear ducts.

Grandpa was so taken by the showing we organized for him a few days prior---he's
gotten me and himself included into the deep rabbithole of Criterion's bag of
extras for the film. We watched all the deleted scenes, interviews with Tony
Rayns, interviews with Wong Kar-Wai himself, documentaries on making the
movie. Grandpa surprised me by his sheer interest in consuming everything about
/In the Mood for Love/, which once again cements its timeless status.
