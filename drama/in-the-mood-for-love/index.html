Maman asked me to see it—feelings that are truly, one of a kind. Specially woke up around 6am to see it in the quiet darkness by myself before the day kicks in. Today was a good day.

There isn’t much I can say—what are my words even worth when trying to describe this masterpiece with so-called “words.” Sometimes, even a trained skill of articulation would fail you if it were never meant to be the right tool to communicate non-verbal nuances like Wong Kar-wai does in his picture. Love. Lust. Desire.

I have a massive weak spot for the Hong Kong and Kowloon-esque style of everything from the 1960s. “Kowloon Generic Romance” is a manga series that capitalizes on this as well. Let me tell you, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung look stunningly gorgeous. You hear me. Stunningly. Gorgeous. My vocabulary had a short circuit throughout the film and the only coherent thought I could murmur out, <em>“stunningly... gorgeous...”</em>

I’m thoroughly convinced that they do not make people like this. It is something truly beyond. You know cinema when you see it, as they say.

<strong>August 25th, 2024</strong><br>Whenever the entirety of human race is long extinct, close to nil of anything remaining that proves our existence but ashes and dust of what was once great—I wish this picture perseveres through time, such that whoever finds it after we’re far gone can see that we did at once exist and lived to the standards of what makes us human in the first place.

<strong>December 27th, 2024</strong><br>Introducing this film to my partner’s grandpa—what a real treat. Yet again, <em>In the Mood for Love</em> is an all-time masterpiece. Absolute magnum opus of what cinema should strive to be. An experimentation with art and style to such an extreme extent that the end product results in something so wholly unique that it captures the hearts of millions throughout all time.

<strong>January 1st, 2025</strong><br>Watching <em>In the Mood for Love</em> again four days later to introduce it to my partner’s sister. God. What a beauty. I’ve seen this film so many times already, yet every time, there are a few moments, where without even really consciously thinking on anything—I get such a jolt of electricity throughout my body, goosebumps on my back, and tears involuntarily leaving my tear ducts.

Grandpa was so taken by the showing we organized for him a few days prior—he’s gotten me and himself included into the deep rabbithole of Criterion’s bag of extras for the film. We watched all the deleted scenes, interviews with Tony Rayns, interviews with Wong Kar-Wai himself, documentaries on making the movie. Grandpa surprised me by his sheer interest in consuming everything about <em>In the Mood for Love</em>, which once again cements its timeless status.
