* Woman in Witness Protection
Torpedoing ourselves back from the late 80s to late 90s, a perfect decade, I
find myself in the same situation of seeing all the familiar faces maturing yet
again with age as we come out of /A Taxing Woman/. Not much is different; Nobuko
Miyamoto is the star that will steal the show, but in ways I could not have
foreseen. Her acting was absolutely superb and it was the first for me in seeing
the range she can pull between scenes and within the same scene as well. Going
from a ramen chef to a tax inspector to a supermarket manager to an actor---she
feels so familiar; probably all thanks to how comfortable she feels in each one
of her roles, therefore making all of us, me, the viewer comfortable with her.

At times lacking a certain grit or missing a mark on the pace of how fast or how
slow the story moves---it overall delivered a cohesive and sound story. Most
definitely more of a current times picture than his other film, Juzo Itami
transmits the message of dangers of cults and their influence on societies; in
certain times, holding such a tight grip that no one would dare to speak against
or get forcibly silenced before they would ever get a chance to do so. It is not
worth bringing up their name---they hurt people, they killed people, they ruined
lives, they evaporated hopes, and cut life's ambitions short.

I genuinely had not expected Juzo Itami to introduce such gore and visual
violence in his films. A baby or an older man sucking on a woman's tit is a
staple in all of his movies; there was a stark tonal shift with /Woman in
Witness Protection/. It's darker, grimier, and oddly less charming in its Juzo
Itami magic like /Supermarket Woman/ would be. That does not mean it is in any way
bad, but distinctly different. There is less of hope and fairy taily stuff to
rely on---the world presents itself in its continuous shift towards ugly and
takes us on a spin to witness and experience the changing times of Japan.

It is hard to think that this would be Juzo Itami's last. It is not one of his
best works. It is one of his best acted and most realistic works. Charming
returning cast of actors bring a little solace to the grim reality of the film,
but nowhere near to salvage it as the script constrained their roles to those of
supporting characters with little to steer the plot in any meaningful
way. Trying to conclude my thoughts on this one is becoming a bit of a
challenge, as I don't have much to say of substance. It is an important film to
understand Juzo Itami and Nobuko Miyamoto shines in her role like no other.
