Classic of the times---I think it must have been more than a decade since the
last time I saw this movie. Good thing I haven't remembered much---nothing
really---about the plot nor even the actors. Did not recall initially that
Madeleine Stowe was in it and I myself just found out that there is a TV show
based on the film, which is kinda lame. However, let's get back to the
substance.

It's a good movie and Bruce Willis actually cares about whatever he's doing
throughout the story, which is a rare sight. However, Brad Pitt totally stole
the show every time he appeared on the screen. Solid story straight from the 90s
and it's one of those ``they don't make'em like they used to'' with all the
bloom and camera angles and the grimey feel of the streets---a bygone era. An
honest 6/10 if I had to give it a numeric score.
