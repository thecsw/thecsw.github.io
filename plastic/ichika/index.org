Ichika doesn't need many angles to capture her beauty -- she already is
perfect.

When my friends and I started watching quintessential quintuplets (took us 6+
months to finish!), I got the Ichika merch before I even knew who she was. You
could say I invested into futures.

*Best girl.* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana_Hanazawa][Kana Hanazawa]] did an incredible job delivering a heartfelt and
genuine performance. You can feel how her voice trembles something within your
soul. Just have to listen with the true part of yourself.

She also voiced the [[https://oreimo.fandom.com/wiki/Ruri_Gokou][best girl]] -- our Queen of Nightmare.
