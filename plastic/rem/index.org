** Rem Summer RELAX

I don't remember for sure, but this figure must have been my very first. It's so
clear to me.

On a bright Saturday, I went to one of the gaming stores downtown. Having just
gone through the magic of Re:Zero, I found myself in a state of a trance.

Never thought of getting a figure, until I saw her. Wasn't really sure whether I
should get it or not, but I have definitely felt something within me.

Didn't buy it and went back home. A day or two later, I found myself thinking
about it too much, which was a sign that this chance should not be toyed with. 

Sprinted downtown after classes and there she was. *The last one.* Why could have
known the path I was about to take myself on.
