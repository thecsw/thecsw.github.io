I might have lied in the [[../rem][previous page]] -- I must have bought the Summer Rem
figure and Winter Darkness at the same time! It is possible I saw both of them
and decided to break bank (I was still just a university student then)

*I wuv her.* You know, [[https://sandyuraz.com/darkness][my whole website builder]] was named just after her and
 always will be. Something about Darkness and her unrelenting strength of being
 herself, yet keeping it real and genuine with others, it inspires me ‚ù§Ô∏è
