I might have lied in the [[../rem][previous page]] -- I must have bought the Summer Rem
figure and Winter Darkness at the same time! It is possible I saw both of them
and decided to break bank (I was still just a university student then)

*I wuv her.* You know, [[https://sandyuraz.com/darkness][my whole website builder]] was named just after her and
 always will be. Something about Darkness and her unrelenting strength of being
 herself, yet keeping it real and genuine with others. Inspiring. ❤️
