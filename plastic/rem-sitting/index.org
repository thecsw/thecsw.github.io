I've been scrolling through a couple of [[https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Rem/Image_Gallery][pictures of Rem from the anime]]. There is
a distinct feeling of "being home" when I see her. Heartwarmingly
welcoming. It's hard to put it into words exactly. Still, I can see why it is
almost impossible to recover financially if you take a liking to her.

It may be because of the time that I watched /Re:Zero/. I would call it the best
time of my life -- I remember it so fondly. It was the winter break of my senior
year. It lasted for around a month, my roommate went to see his relatives, and
everyone else did somewhat similar. It was just me in my apartment for the whole
month.

I don't remember leaving the place throughout the break. I must have had a
mountain of ramen stashed up in my kitchen closet, so much that it might have
rivaled some nations' strategic reserves. Like a goblin or a hobbit stuck in a
cave. Ah, what a time. I miss it sometimes.

I ate ramen, went to bed at like 4 am every night (or morning?), woke up in the
early afternoon, did some chores, and watched anime. One of those shows was
/Re:Zero/. A funny little note, I watched the first one or two episodes with my
roommate, who didn't like it and dropped it. I decided to stick with it and look
where we ended up. *In the best timeline.*
