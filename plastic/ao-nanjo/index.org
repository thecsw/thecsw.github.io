* Ao Nanjo ðŸ©±

I'm in love with [[https://kaoming.fanbox.cc/][Kaoming's]] works and characters they bring to life so
effortlessly. So much so that I pre-ordered their [[https://meccha-japan.com/en/figuresmecha/73089-figure-ao-nanjo-illustrated-by-kaomin.html][Ao Nanjo bathing suit figure]]
almost a year and a half in advance---it was almost a complete and total
disappointment. Do not believe the pictures, as they are not accurate---with the
bathing suit not being as translucent as shown---with hair made in too simple
shapes---with the plastic on the eyes being lower quality---with the general
feel and edges looking rough; it was a bust. Unfortunately, an oversell on the
sculptor's and marketing's side---it's only OK.
