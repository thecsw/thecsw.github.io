This one was probably one of the least expensive figures I got (~$20), but the
relative quality is *insane*. You have translucent hair, great sculpting, and soft
plastic used for a clothes-like feel. 

When I was still in my senior year of college, I had her standing on the living
room table right by our apartment's entrance. It must have been around that time
that I became more secure about my interest in figures and anime merchandise. 

My relatives, partners, and friends used to come around, and only then would I
get reminded that it's not so often you see figures like these in people's
apartments. Well, in many ways, it /makes me happy/, so why wouldn't I live in my
own little world?
