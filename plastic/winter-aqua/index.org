I never understood why people hate on Aqua from Konosuba. Sure, she always
complains. Sure, she is not reliable -- like at all. Sure, she is usually more
trouble than she's worth. But hey, hard to imagine life without her.

She gives the morale support and no matter what, won't ever go behind your
back. There is something you can never take away from her.

Aqua has life and the energy in her. Love her. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
