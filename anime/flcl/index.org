* FLCL ðŸŽ¸ 

52; 12022 H.E.

One time I heard someone describe FLCL as a fever dream of an anime. I think
this reaction is justified, yet doesn't do it the full honor it deserves. FLCL
is by far *the most unique and thrilling* anime I have ever seen. Not only by its
animation style choice, not only by its plot, not only by the ideas itâ€™s
evoking, but with the combination of everything listed and more, it creates
something truly wonderful.  

My close friends know that I have a weak spot for GAINAX and TRIGGER works,
especially anything that Hiroyuki Imaishi touches. This one is no
exception. It's a bit of an old show, the same year that I was born, the
wild 2000. It's freely accessible on [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWyV9Ojt6_BlwTmnDtvHTCtq1cpUTz5Hr][youtube]]. There are only six 20 minute long
episodes, so it would be blasphemous of you not to watch it. This post will be a
little different, because the show is *so short*, yet *so incredibly dense*, I'll be
making quick comments on my favorite parts and linking other essays that will do
a better job explaining the core of Fooly Cooly.

FLCL is furiously fast-paced, unapologetic in what it is trying to do, and most
of all, it is also *highly* experimental. Everything ranging from the art style,
creative design choices, all the way to voice acting, and character-building is
something you would not witness anywhere else, not even close. Oh my god, FLCL
is accompanied by fabulous [[http://pillows.jp][the pillows]], whose songs go so hard that it almost
feels as if it came from outer space. Please give the one below a good listen.

Have you ever seen a [[https://youtu.be/qmYt-zAW2aY?list=PLWyV9Ojt6_BlwTmnDtvHTCtq1cpUTz5Hr&t=656][whole scene]] animated as if it were a manga? I'm not talking
about /Yakuza Turned Housewife/, which is a PowerPoint with voices over. I'm
talking about a fully dynamic scene, where the camera actively pans from one
part of the manga page to another, where the manga itself is animated and truly
brought to life. It takes some real creativity and courage to show such a scene
to your audience.  

Inexplicably, no matter how crazy the plot is, how little we know about anything
that's happening in front of our eyes, or how more and more surreal the feelings
get, FLCL accomplishes brilliantly at reducing the emotional friction between
you and the show's atmosphere to something very close to nil. It absorbs you
into its world, into its commitment to its belief, while keeping you
energetically warm and excited for what comes next. This is the best I can put
when typing this late at night, just because I felt I had to write about it.

Fooly Cooly is a coming-of-age story. Accepting yourself, your life, taking
responsibility for your actions, stopping whining about life, and instead,
living it with everything you are given in the moment of now. You may consider
all the characters as little kids that can't show you anything worthy of your
attention and that would be your first mistake, and prove that the above claim
doesn't hold.  

If [[https://kitsu.io/users/AngMang][someone]] tells me Mamimi is their favorite character, or any character from
FLCL at that point, I would immediately know they do be real for that. There is
something so genuine about the problems, desires, and conflicts that our
characters face, such that for a regular modern viewer, it may seem all too
boring or naive. I would dare to say that people making those claims lack the
subtlety of a soul, of their emotional harmony to be able to notice thin, yet
thrilling currents flowing in and out.   

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVbpA94Zek3v6wZ8E2Dh60g][Hiding in Public]] has produced one of the best anime video essays I have ever
seen on the platform. Highly recommend watching his [[https://youtu.be/Jk8rHHMS0FY][The Lie of Relationships in
FLCL]] and [[https://youtu.be/FCEaZxahYiQ][They're Fake]]. It goes over some of the main topics very well, to the
point that I would rather not paraphrase his thoughts into my own, better watch
and enjoy the source. Thank you for keeping up with me on this absurd post I
wrote falling asleep. It is my wish that people could enjoy FLCL for what it is,
embrace all the drugs itâ€™s on, and truly become a [[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fooly+Cooly][Fooly Cooly connoisseur]].
