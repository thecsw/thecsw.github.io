* Banished from the Hero's Party ðŸª´

4; 12022 H.E.

Hello! Hope youâ€™re doing well today. This is my first anime review; I donâ€™t know
the best format to follow. I think Iâ€™m the only person who will read this, so
Iâ€™ll write it myself. If youâ€™re not me, Godspeed. Shall we? 

#+drop_cap

The first thing to get out of the way is the title of this show. The full title
is /Banished from the Heroâ€™s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the
Countryside/, which is rather long. To avoid writing it all out, Iâ€™ll refer to
the show simply by /Banished/.

Let me tell you something from the beginning, I absolutely loved this show. I
knew nothing of the show; I found it randomly on MyAnimeList. I didnâ€™t even know
what isekai meant and what the whole genre entails. I walked into the show with
a very open mindset about a day or two before New Yearâ€™s Eve.

I have a weak spot for a slice-of-life style of shows. Something slower in plot
progression, fewer notable battles or heroic encounters, but more of an
introspective into our daily routine that life is made out of. It is incredibly
calming and simply... welcoming! I would even dare to say wholesome.

Reading some reviews that people left, they criticize people for liking this
genre for being too ``naÃ¯ve'' and ``simple-minded'' to enjoy this isekai genre. In
many ways, I can see their argument. Itâ€™s no Death Note, Neon Genesis
Evangelion, or other on-the-surface-deep-thought-provoking plots with endless
schemes and betrayals. Does it need to be that? 

#+drop_cap
This is worth its own ``opinion'' post. Still, modern audiences are spoiled with
the thought of feeling intelligent and profound by watching dark/tragic
shows. Thinking the depth of meaning is equivalent to its respective ``darkness.''
The first example that comes to mind is Joker. What a horrible movie.

This fallacy leads people onto the path of pseudo-intelligence and
trivialization of essential questions and topics down to bad-taste jokes and
taking things too far. This needless exercise in tragedy is what prevents people
from enjoying even simple shows for what they are trying to be. It sucks the fun
out of anything if you are a cynical person.

Coming from that drifted-over discussion back to Banished. There is no secret to
enjoying what it has to offer. Take it in for what itâ€™s supposed to be. It can
even be cheesy in some spots, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re here for. To enjoy the
little magic that /Banished/ holds close to its heart. The atmosphere is not the
only thing it has to offer; a big question is being pondered. Letâ€™s talk! I felt
good after watching the show, which is a good sign. 

[[wink.webp][We're on the same page here]]

/Banished/ looks at the old question of ``What is life?'' and ``What does it mean to
be successful in life?'' As Gideon was in the Heroâ€™s Party with Ruti, battling
hordes of demons, onto bringing the fight to the Demon Lord. Sounds pretty
exciting, doesnâ€™t it? It sounds very heroic and noble. What if he were instead
to open an apothecary in a small village and just live a simple life?  

#+drop_cap
Many would find the second route less exciting, less protagonistic, and less
heroic. Would such a thought be proper? In their own right, they are. However,
what is life but a series of events that can be viewed and understood from
infinite angles and worldviews? What is a failure for one is a fulfilled and
happy life for another. Then you might ask me, ``Sandy, where is the truth then?''

I will say that is a good question. How do we live the perfect life? What is a
perfect life? Again, is life about your career? Maybe stature? Your role in
society? Love? Fulfilling your path/destiny? MONEY? It is indeed a great
question. All I can give now in this short anime review is that it is life. What
you do, how you live, just live. Instead of overthinking every step we take, let
us live and put the dot right there.

This is quite a departure from any good review. Weâ€™ll keep it ongoing. Letâ€™s
talk about the characters and the show more specifically then! Mostly about
Gideon, Rit, and Ruti.

[[bench.webp][It's all about the human touch]]

Gideon had a fantastic caliber of humbleness and empathy towards those around
him, which makes a notable difference for the best in your immediate
surroundings. He had the skill that very few people in the world are fortunate
to possess, and thatâ€™s to know who you are and be friends with yourself. Be
content with lifeâ€™s givings and takings by simply moving further. Whatâ€™s done is
done; letâ€™s consider what we do next!

#+drop_cap
I like to entertain the possibility, a realm where we try to approach life more
philosophically. We tend to expect a lot from everything we do, ranging from
financial gains to love to anything else. Itâ€™s only human nature to expect an
equal return for our troubles and efforts. Instead of wishing, we just do what
we do now and have what comes at us. I feel it takes incredible discipline to be
this much at peace with yourself.

[[welcome.webp][I bid your welcome]]

Rit was in a similar situation to Gideon (Red), as they miraculously met again
after departing from their previous adventures together. She also has
expectations from her royal family, subordinates, and people. Are we then just
prisoners of our destinies? By God giving everyone a path in life and a future
with no way out, why are we given free will for?

Maybe we are given some path, some pre-determined set of events, emotions,
feelings, people, places, etc., that we are meant to experience and live through
in the time, we have in this world. Free will is given to make it more fun. One
will still follow the general ``flow'' of their destiny, but how they can approach
it entirely depends on them.

This is something I liked about the way they approach Rutiâ€™s character. The
literal Hero of the land. ``Destined and Blessed by The Almighty to serve as a
protector and fighter, devoid of anything that can impede such a crucial
mission.'' Should one follow and fulfill their path or try to pursue their own
life if they feel it goes against what theyâ€™re required to do?

#+drop_cap
It is only my feeling that we have to live our own lives the way we would want
to live them, of course, within the degree of freedom of our current
situation. Life might be too short to care for, and you spend too much time on
something that goes against your will. Banished teaches you to live your life
and no one elseâ€™s.

Also, the opening song never fails to brighten up the mood for me.

That's all! Thank you for reading.
