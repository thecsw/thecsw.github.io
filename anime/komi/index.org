* Komi-san wa, Komyush≈ç Desu ü•ë

First of all, I have to say that I absolutely loved it. I was pleased to watch
the anime adaptation of Komi Can‚Äôt Communicate. It‚Äôs on [[https://www.netflix.com/title/81228573][Netflix]], so go check it
out! This review will be succinct; you will see why.

Starting the show was a little rough for me. The beginning feels a little dull
due to us not being well acquainted with Tadano Hitohito and Komi Shouko. We‚Äôre
thrown into this wild high school life, where everyone is almost a caricature of
a specific persona type. For whatever reason, the first couple of episodes were
something I just had to get myself through, hoping that it would hook me better
along the way.

And you know what? *I adore it.* I have a weak spot for the Slice of Life shows
and feelings. One of my favorite parts of /Neon Genesis Evangelion/ is the one
with the [[https://youtu.be/Vk2g-2tC5qM][alternate reality]], which is just so (not) wholesome. /Komi/ struck that
beautiful note of having a lightweight and simply endearing atmosphere.

Shouko has one single purpose, and that is to make 100 friends. Hitohito is her
classmate that sincerely wants to help her. Interestingly, all done without an
inherited romantic ploy to get to her. I can go on describing small moments I
enjoyed, but that would border on retelling the story, so it would be better for
you to read the manga or watch the show.

Finally, I need to say that my favorite character is Osana Najimi. She has good
energy and good vibes. Well, he? She? They prefer anything; canonically, their
gender is simply ``Najimi.'' Thanks to her incredible communication skills and
pure talent, she is the complete polar opposite of Komi. There is something
about Najimi-chan whom I utmost admire. The positive energy and sincerity with
people that matter to her/him.
Most importantly...
