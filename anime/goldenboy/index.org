* Golden Boy üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

140; 12023 H.E.

I wanted to write a small post of appreciation for this great show, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Boy_(manga)][/Golden
Boy/]]. A man completes all required university course credits for a Law degree;
instead of graduating as anyone in the ordinary sense would‚ÄîKintaro travels across
Japan, working odd jobs‚Äîall to pursue knowledge and learn
everything a book won't tell you. *A student of life*.

There is so much I would like to say; however, due to the short nature of this
OVA (only 6 ~20min episodes) and its contained story‚ÄîI'll be succinct. /Golden
Boy/ is inspirational in showing you there is /probably/ much more to life
than we think there is. There is never a point where you should /ever/ just *stop*
being curious about everything around you.

Of course, you are ``cool'' and ``jaded''. Surprise. Aren't we all? Cynicism and
a feeling of ``I've seen life'' follows us all, and the fact you succumbed to it
shows nothing noble of your character. Do not deny those negative feelings
either. They don't want to be with you as much as you don't want to be with
them. Fear, jadedness, and apathy are all-natural, but it is our responsibility
and duty to not let those lowly sensations dictate our life or drain us of
energy. Accept them as if you are telling them, ``You can tag along, but I have
other things to do today.''

/Golden Boy/ capitalizes on that big time with Kintaro. The protagonist isn't a
freezer because he isn't ``smart'' or ``ambitious'' enough to get educated,
trained, or employed somewhere. He cleared all Law degree requirements
(with his integrity), and the stories he's in prove otherwise. Kintaro is an
incredibly resourceful and intelligent individual. Instead, he took upon
an adventure I would call myself too much of a coward to /probably/ ever embark
on.

Exploring the different walks of life, getting to know people with all sorts of
diverse backgrounds, and, if ever so shortly, becoming a part of their
lives‚Äîevery time almost as if by some miraculous accident, helping them to
overcome challenges they're faced with. While at that, Kintaro faces 
challenges with skills and life lessons he picked up in his ventures. Be
it working in a women-only software company, udon shop, swimming pool, and
more. \ ^{{(I should mention, /we all *can* and *should* do this/)}}

The ambiance of the OVA stuck with me because it touched something I have been
consciously worried about‚ÄîI don't get to see people as often as I wish. Maybe
I'm over-brewing in some parts. At least in my area, I wish there were more of a
diversity of people to learn about and interact with. Of course, the show has more of
an idealized presentation of being a ``free spirit,'' especially when compared
to modern tendencies of [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/23/americans-alone-thanksgiving-friends/][loneliness]], [[https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic][social media dividing]] [[https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls][rather than uniting]],
and [[https://www.city-journal.org/article/alone][much more]].

Day-dreaming about getting out there, pushing yourself into new opportunities to
learn, fail, and succeed while also experiencing life from all kinds of unique
perspectives [[https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average][is far from new]]. At the very least, it would be good to remind
ourselves how to hold onto that sensation and pure emotion such that our
thoughts created by them stay authentic and genuine to who we are. Go, watch /Golden
Boy/ (apparently free on [[https://archive.org/details/golden-boy-english-dubbed-anime-480p/Golden+Boy+Episode+1+English+Dubbed+Anime-(480p).mp4][Internet Archive]]) and see if there is something in it
for you.

Oh, and btw, the show is /very suggestive/.
