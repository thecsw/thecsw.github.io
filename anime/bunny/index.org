* Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai 🐇❤️

51; 12022 H.E.

My good friend James and I like to send pictures of fine anime art that we find
around by endlessly browsing Twitter, Pixiv, and many places. You can say a gag
between us drove us closer over months, bridging the gap. One fateful day, he
sent me the gif (/g/ is pronounced as graphical, not like a giraffe) below.

He told me it’s from ``Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai.'' What a goofy
title, I thought. *I have to see it.* I started it promptly in a couple of days. I
would watch it religiously in a bit of a lonely yet reaffirming part of my
life. The one review I can give to summarize my thoughts and opinions on this
show would be that every night, after watching an episode and listening to the
ending song, I would fall asleep with a smile.

What is this anime about? I will try to express the feelings and ideas conveyed
without giving out too much of the plot or twists and turns you will encounter
when going through the episodes. The story follows a second-year high school
student, Azusagawa Sakuta (梓川 咲太), who meets several girls that are
experiencing ``puberty syndrome,'' which is caused by sensitivity and instability
during adolescence.

Puberty syndrome is an abnormal experience mainly triggered by one’s mental
state and torn feelings regarding something. I would say it is a manifestation
of one’s insecurities taking shape in the real world in weird (frankly
terrifying) situations, like no one able to interact with you, groundhog days,
and memory loss. The only way to resolve them is to come to peace with your
inner state and have the resolve to accept yourself for who you are while also
becoming your own friend and a friend of the people around you.

What an absolutely /incredible/ study of a fragile human mind of ours. In
comparison with many other shows, this one keeps the events and surroundings
very much grounded in reality, where the main plot usually unfolds in school
classrooms or an apartment. Thanks to such familiar surroundings, the show
can only present itself as more relatable to its viewer. It feels comfy, it feels
warm, it builds this amazing atmosphere, where you simply don't want to leave
anyone behind. A show would rarely make such an effect on me.

It warms my heart to see the relationship they built between Mai and
Sakuta. Most movies and shows have a problem portraying a real relationship,
with all its inherited complexities and natural beauty. Many end up having a
caricature of a relationship that’s either too artificial or needlessly
miserable. I sincerely hope that people can be as mature as Mai and Sakuta to
have that mutual respect, understanding, loyalty, and healthy communication flow
between the two. (saying everything all the time that bothers you is not an
example of good communication, have a restraint)

The art is unique. I'm amazed how they found the most perfect soundtrack for the
show. I cannot ignore one of the coolest opening songs to date, which is
the top 3 of my anime music collection
