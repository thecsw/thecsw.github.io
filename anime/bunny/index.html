My good friend James and I like to send each other pictures of fine anime art that we find around by endlessly browsing twitter, pixiv, and many places alike. You can say it is a gag between us that drove us closer over months, bridging the gap. One fateful day, he sent me the gif (<em>g</em> is pronounced as graphical, not like a giraffe) below

He told me it’s from &#34;Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai&#34;. What a goofy title I thought. <strong>I have to see it.</strong> I started it promptly in a couple of days. I would watch it religiously in a bit of a lonely, yet reaffirming part of my life. The one review I can give to summarize my thoughts and opinions on this show would be that every night, after watching an episode and listening to the ending song, I would fall asleep with a smile on my face.

What is this anime about? I will try to express the feelings and ideas conveyed, without giving out too much of the plot or twists and turns you will encounter when going through the episodes. The story follows a second-year high school student, Azusagawa Sakuta (梓川 咲太), who meets several girls that are experiencing &#34;puberty syndrome&#34;, which is caused by sensitivity and instability during adolescence.

Puberty syndrome is an abnormal experience, which is mainly triggered by one’s mental state and torn feelings regarding something. I would say it is a manifestation of one’s insecurities taking shape in the real world in form of weird (frankly terrifying) situations, like no one able to interact with you, groundhog days, and memory loss. The only way to resolve them is coming at peace with your inner state and having the resolve of accepting yourself for who you are, whilst also becoming your own friend and a friend of people around.

What an absolutely <em>incredible</em> study of a fragile human mind of ours. In comparison with many other shows, this one keeps the events and surroundings very much grounded in reality, where the main plot usually unfolds in school classrooms or an apartment. Thanks to such familiar surroundings, the show can only present itself as more relatable to its viewer. It feels comfy, it feels warm, it builds this amazing atmosphere, where you simply don’t want to leave anyone behind. A show would rarely make such an effect on me.

It warms my heart to see the relationship they built between Mai and Sakuta. Most movies and shows have a problem portraying a real relationship, with all its inherited complexities and natural beauty. Many end up having a caricature of a relationship, that’s either too artificial or needlessly miserable. It is my sincere hope that people can be as mature as Mai and Sakuta to have that mutual respect, understanding, loyalty, and truly healthy communication flow between the two. (saying everything all the time that bothers you is not an example of good communication, have a restraint)

The art is unique. I&#39;m amazed how they found the most perfect soundtrack for the show. I cannot ignore one of the coolest opening songs to date, which is the top 3 of my anime music collection
