Horimiya is one of the most realistic depictions of the first love I have ever watched. It captured the beauty, awkwardness, embarrassment, and vivid colors of what it means to fall in love for the first time. I would even dare to say the privilege of almost feeling like being a part of it. It’s good to be young.

This will be a short review, as most of what I have to say is encapsulated above. It is usually a rare feat for films and media set in high school settings to portray real emotions and feelings. Most are slapstick comedies (think of any Disney/CN/Nick show), super cringey (anything coming out now), and way over the top on the life part.

I love Dostoyevsky; many would claim that he goes over the top; however, his stories are more nuanced, as he explores every soul as if it were a whole Universe. However, I must note that this “over the top” simply talks about a story that lacks genuine emotions, which makes them desperate to over-compensate that with writing that has no restraints. It reads dull and disconnected from reality. We will have another time for him.

Horimiya was nothing like it. The relationship built between Hori and Miyamura felt natural and genuine. How first love blooms, develops, and how it must go through thick and thin to last have meaning that goes beyond the initial inexperience of lovers, so it can grow into stability and mutual understanding. What does it mean to give colors of life to your loved one? To be close to someone.

Every human is their whole Universe, which is yet to be found and loved by their special someone. They explored different relationships, lives, and people around them, like their classmates and friends (or yet-to-be friends). The successes in love, failures, misunderstandings, and selfishness were a part of the story, which made it so much more relatable. <b style="color:var(--color-tomb)">◼︎</b>
