* Horimiya üç∞

79; 12022 H.E.

Horimiya is one of the most realistic depictions of the first love I have ever had
the pleasure of watching. I would even dare to say, the privilege of almost
feeling as being a part of it. It captured the beauty, awkwardness,
embarrassment, and vivid colors of what it means to fall in love for the first
time. It's good to be young.

This is going to be a short review, as most of what I have to say is
encapsulated above. It is usually a rare feat for films and media set in high
school settings to portray real emotions and feelings. Most of them are
either slapstick comedies (think of any Disney/CN/Nick show), super cringey
(anything that is coming out now), and way over the top on the life part.

However, I *must* note, this "over the top" simply talks about a story that lacks
true emotions, which makes them desperate to over-compensate that with writing
that has no restraints. It reads dull and disconnected from reality. I love
Dostoyevsky, many would claim that he goes over the top, however, his stories
are more nuanced, as he explores every soul as if it were a whole Universe. We
will have another time for him.

Horimiya was nothing like it. The relationship built between Hori and Miyamura
felt natural and genuine. How first love blooms, develops, and how it must go
through thick and thin to last, have meaning that goes beyond the initial
inexperience of lovers, so it can grow into stability and mutual understanding.

They went further into exploring different relationships, lives, and people
around them, like their classmates and friends (or yet to be friends). The
successes in love, failures, misunderstandings, selfishness, all of it were a
part of the story, which made it so much more relatable. Every human is their
own whole Universe, which is yet to be found and loved by their special
someone.
