* To Be Hero X üòé
They had no reason to cook /this/ hard. I believe this must have been a sting
operation of some sort, since when I found out about this show, /nobody/ was
talking about it and even the most hardcore anime-watching-following-all-seasons
friends I have, nobody had heard of this Chinese show. Only seeing the [[https://youtu.be/08kp3Cs31Ow][original
trailer]] of the show had ignited our curiosity from nil to over elevent in a few
moments' time that we called /everybody/ for an emergency council meeting, every
two weeks, where we would sit down and witness /To Be Hero X/ unfold, waiting for
our hero /X/ to finally appear.

It is the only show who's opening goes so hard that we had not dared to skip the
opening nor the ending even once, since the /Comission/ would have broken down the
door into our place and indicted everyone for solitary in an auraless room as a
punishment for disrespecting our one and only true God,
/X/. Just. What. A. Banger.

You /must/ go and watch it. There isn't much I want to say, as I have probably
spoken at length about everything right this show had done to everybody that had
seen the show. Regurgitating it again here would be reductionary to what I have
had already expressed /and/ it would be repeating the plot, where the writers had
done a job better than I ever could. But, I will say, I have not seen a show yet
like this that flips my view and understanding of scenes shown before as much as
/To Be Hero X/, where episode 23 changes /everything/ we know about episode 1 and so
much more in between.

[[inf.webp][I have to step frame-by-frame to find something I'd missed.]]

This is a pure 10/10 show that is nothing but distilled aura-farming straight to
the veins and must be enjoyed in the way it was intended. If somebody is good
with a specific art style, when the Japanese shows at large suffer from the
repetitiveness of ``generic anime'' feel, /To Be Hero X/ flexes the mastery of so
many styles and attaching their importance to the plot is simply flexing on
their part. The music and soundtrack are too addicting. Hardest drug. They had
absolutely no business cooking /this/ hard.
