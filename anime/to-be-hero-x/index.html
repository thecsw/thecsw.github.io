They had no reason to cook <em>this</em> hard. I believe this must have been a sting operation of some sort, since when I found out about this show, <em>nobody</em> was talking about it and even the most hardcore anime-watching-following-all-seasons friends I have, nobody had heard of this Chinese show. Only seeing the <a href="https://youtu.be/08kp3Cs31Ow" title="">original trailer</a> of the show had ignited our curiosity from nil to over elevent in a few moments’ time that we called <em>everybody</em> for an emergency council meeting, every two weeks, where we would sit down and witness <em>To Be Hero X</em> unfold, waiting for our hero <em>X</em> to finally appear.

It is the only show who’s opening goes so hard that we had not dared to skip the opening nor the ending even once, since the <em>Comission</em> would have broken down the door into our place and indicted everyone for solitary in an auraless room as a punishment for disrespecting our one and only true God, <em>X</em>. Just. What. A. Banger.

You <em>must</em> go and watch it. There isn’t much I want to say, as I have probably spoken at length about everything right this show had done to everybody that had seen the show. Regurgitating it again here would be reductionary to what I have had already expressed <em>and</em> it would be repeating the plot, where the writers had done a job better than I ever could. But, I will say, I have not seen a show yet like this that flips my view and understanding of scenes shown before as much as <em>To Be Hero X</em>, where episode 23 changes <em>everything</em> we know about episode 1 and so much more in between.

This is a pure 10/10 show that is nothing but distilled aura-farming straight to the veins and must be enjoyed in the way it was intended. If somebody is good with a specific art style, when the Japanese shows at large suffer from the repetitiveness of “generic anime” feel, <em>To Be Hero X</em> flexes the mastery of so many styles and attaching their importance to the plot is simply flexing on their part. The music and soundtrack are too addicting. Hardest drug. They had absolutely no business cooking <em>this</em> hard.
