* MY BOOKS

I remember growing up next to shelves filled with books of all widths and
genres. My parents gave me the taste of collecting books such that one day, when
their time comes, someone will read them. It kick-started my love for literature
and where I am now. In 2016, while I was living in Armenia, I went to a small
(literal hole in the wall) indie bookstore in one of their underground malls
near the main theater.

Perusing through the books I saw beautiful yellow softcovers of Asimov's
/Foundation/ series. Having had an avid appetite for science fiction, as I have
had it for a number of years prior since my middle school teacher had introduced
me to Stanisław Lem's /Golem XIV/.. I did not second guess myself on buying the entire
trilogy and one of the novels. In that moment, I had no idea of what those books
were about nor in what order I should read them or what they present of
themselves.

No matter where I went, those books were always with me. Whether I traveled back
home, seeing friends, or going on a little trip to a nearby town, /Foundation/
books were always with me and they remained untouched. Only when covid had
struck in 2020 and freed me from any and all obligations to what was ``normal''
university life, I decided it was time to pick up reading for pleasure
again. (The real reason is that there was not much else to do in my shoe
box-sized dorm).

The trilogy first. Then the sequels. Then the endless ``quick'' runs over to my
town's local library to borrow and buy any and all science fiction books I could
get my hands on. Shortly after, maybe about a year or so, I gave a heart attack
to my engineering advisor by letting them know that I had enrolled in a
literature major. I was quickly disowned in the eyes of academic advising and
left on my own (not really, I had /other/ staff I could talk to) to figure out 
how to jungle the three majors I got myself in. The rest is history. Welcome!

What you see below is a collection of books that I could write down on this
page. There is no rhythm, harmony, or strategy to the ordering of these
books; nor does it show which ones I had completed reading vs. the ones that are
waiting for their turn to. They're loosely correlated by their physical location
on my shelves.
