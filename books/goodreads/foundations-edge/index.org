I must confessâ€”I don't remember specifically the middle point between this and
Foundation and Earth, but Asimov's writing is always what I like to call, "the
perfect English." And this is a great companion to the original Foundation
trilogy, as every civilization is doomed for the similar fate. If the history
doesn't repeat itself, it definitely rhymes.
