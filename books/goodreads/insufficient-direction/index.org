This was a great and what felt like, a deeply personal read, which it definitely
is. To get a peek into what it must be like to see legendary Hideaki Anno behind
the scenes‚Äîin a day-to-day like routine, all through a collection of anecdotal
stories, events of which are in some places could be exaggerated, shuffled
around, all to make it all the funnier‚Äîwhat a big heart Moyoco Anno injected
into her work.

Maybe I'm also deep into the ota-sphere, as I found all the geeking out on old
shows, endless references, and expensive merchandise (looking at you, kamen
rider belts and figurines) super charming.

The foreword (?) by Hideaki Anno says it best,

What's amazing about my wife's manga is that she doesn't create any "out" from
reality. [...]
Instead of making you want to dwell in yourself, her manga makes you want to
go outside and do something, it emboldens you. It's a manga for tackling
reality and living among others. [...]
Her manga accomplished what I couldn't do in Eva to the end. It was a big shock
to me, really.
