One of my all-time favorites of science fiction and in all. Young Asimov's novel
technologically doesn't hold up with the times, such as still using coal for
rockets and no computers; yet it doesn't have to. It is a detailed study of
sociology and how people interact with each other. The focus is on the human
aspect rather than shiny technical aspects, which many contemporary authors
prioritize over the human touch. Beautiful! Early Asimov in a nutshell.
