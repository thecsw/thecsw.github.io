* The Star with No Name ⭐️

After seeing the Soviet adaptation of the play, directed by Mikhail Kozakov
(playing Grig), and starring Anastasiya Vertinskaya (Mona) and Igor Kostolevsky
(Marin Miroiu)—I decided to write a comparative analysis between the play and
the picture for my graduate level film class.

Every time I come back to it, whether after a related personal experience, or
whenever I have the feeling of getting in touch with the message Mihail
Sebastian implanted at the story's core—I always get reminded of what a little
known piece of art the film and the play is.

Because truly, ``No star deviates from its path.''
