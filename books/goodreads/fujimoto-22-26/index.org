I think I enjoyed this collection of stories a bit more than his selection from
/17-21: Tatsuki Fujimoto/, especially /Nayuta of the Prophecy/, where Nayuta is
probably one my favorite characters that Fujimoto has come up with. The core
themes felt to hit close home with family relationships and how we come to
understand each other as relatives, brothers, sisters, and loved ones.
