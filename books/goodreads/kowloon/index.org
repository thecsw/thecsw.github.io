*Melancholic, Gloomy, Yet Incredibly Captivating*

An interesting story of a *truly* generic romance in a nostalgic land of Kowloon
Walled City. The pacing and ambience that the story takes you in is weirdly
soothing. It strikes that niche I always knew I craved for, but couldn't put
into words for so long. Kowloon Generic Romance is different from regular manga,
as it focuses more on the adult romance and worries that come with
it. Refreshing and intriguing. I'm in.
