* I.L

I rarely ever open goodreads but when I do, I have a flaming desire to share
something either of a magnificent and of an unforgettable read, or something so
vile that my dissatisfaction cannot be contained. I am beyond happy to report
that today is the day for me to share the former.

Never heard of Osamu Tezuka's /I.L/ and now I will not forget it. Reading through
a couple reviews on this site, I'll spare the boring wikipedia
paraphrasing. Usually, I tend to be biased against political artwork, since it
being such a low-hanging fruit that it is almost lazy to tackle.

Something about the dichotomy between the atrocities committed by humans and
Alucard being cute, the classical manga art style and the minutely drawn details
of absolute horrors depicted, the complete absence of the notion that things
have to have a closure or a happy ending vs. to today's taste palette. How
effortless it all is.

Read it.
