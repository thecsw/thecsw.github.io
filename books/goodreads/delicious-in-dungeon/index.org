* Delicious in Dungeon 🥩

Brings out the charm of more vintage RPGs and food wars style preparations of
monster ingredients. Superb art style! I enjoyed reading the first volume, even
though dungeon-crawling and fantasy settings are unfortunately not my preferred
genre. Still, I would be interested to know how it goes, especially since
TRIGGER is coming out with the anime adaptation of it pretty soon. I'll try to
stay up to date, maybe buy the manga, and read it when the time is right.
