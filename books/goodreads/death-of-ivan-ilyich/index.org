What a harrowing read. Tolstoy has never been as close to my heard as Dostoevsky
is, but this might be my favorite work of his. I have decided to finally read it
after watching Akira Kurosawa's ``Ikiru,'' which was loosely based on ``The
Death of Ivan Ilyich.''

This is a tale of what a seemingly perfect life can unravel into when the very
foundation of this perfect facade is hiding a treasure trove of shallowness,
materialism, and severe lack of true feelings of love, passion, and genuine
happiness.

The most telling part of all of this was the fact that Ivan Ilyich, the
eponymous character of the story was not a bad man. Not at all, nothing even
close. He was an everyday man that you will see throughout your entire life and
very will might be one.

When life pushes you to an extreme, revealing all missed opportunities,
revealing all real feelings that before had been hidden behind layers of
politeness and civility‚Äîwhen all of it is gone‚Äîthere is nothing left but a pile
of regrets, anguish, and desperation, which all turn a man into a beast with
nothing to lose nor care about.

Harrowing experience. This is the most mundane turn of events that can and will
happen to anybody, even and especially to the most regular and respectable
person. The question is, how do you live?
