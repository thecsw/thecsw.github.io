I mean... This is *The Overcoat*. As Dostoevsky put it, "we all come from under
Gogol's The Overcoat," such as the entirety of Russian Literature can be
deconstructed through Akaky Akakievich.

The tragedy and comedy of a life of a "little person," someone who is not of a
particular value to society‚Äîsomeone, who is drifting through time, one moment
entering life, and another time leaving it. Without really making much of an
impression onto anyone or anything on its path.

Whereas Gogol sharpened his pencil to ridicule the indifferent society, the
"little man," and then later make us grow closer to Akaky Akakievich, Dostoevsky
had something different in his mind.

Hopefully this is intriguing enough to get started on "The Overcoat." If you
want to understand the core of what it means for literature to be "Russian,"
this is its heart. Eugene Onegin would be its soul.
