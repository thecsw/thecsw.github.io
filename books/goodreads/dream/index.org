If you don't have the time, energy, or the right circumstances to dive deep and
expose yourself to Dostoevsky's larger novels, like Brothers Karamazov, The
Idiot, Crime and Punishment, etc.â€”The Dream of a Ridiculous Man would be a
perfect introduction to Fyodor Mikhailovich. I consider it to be the condensed
version of Dostoevskian philosophy.

What does it mean to love one another? The human decency to see and treat each
other as brothersâ€”every day, actively, and tirelessly. Even if others won't get
it.
