* Komi Can’t Communicate ❤️

I am biased towards this series, as it gave me support and warmth in times when
I needed one the most. Impulsively buying the first 14-15 volumes at once from
B&N, bedridden a while later, Komi and friends were my trusty companions, with
whom I shared time, which is so near and dear to me.

This is of course, a perfect one for me, not only because it has a special
connection to me—it's overall a fantastic series on something not a lot of
relationship-based works talk about—how do you make friends? (and not just
romantic partners)

I spoke a bit more about Komi and how it [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/komi/][ties in with my love for Dostoevsky]].
