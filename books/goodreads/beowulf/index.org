Any modern action movie, epic tales, anything really, can and will be tied back
to Beowulf. It's a bit of a tougher read, as contemporary readers—we aren't used
to tens and hundreds of pages worth of digressions into someone's family trees
and ballads of their greatness, when they're simply being introduced at a dinner
table.

This is a true epic. The scale and style of which defined our tastes in tales
and action-packed stories. Be prepared to apply some effort to get through the
whole work.
