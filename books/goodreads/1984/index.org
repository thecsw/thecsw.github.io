Cartoonish levels of depicting oppressive governments with very little to no
foresight and imagination to come up with something that has more meat to the
matter, rooted deeper into a future that might be, all ending up reading as
Orwell's personal gripe with Stalinism.

I highly recommend reading Isaac Asimov's [[http://www.newworker.org/ncptrory/1984.htm][review of 1984]], as he said,

So I read it and found myself absolutely astonished at what I read. I wondered
how many people who talked about the novel so glibly had ever read it; or if
they had, whether they remembered it at all.\
I felt I would have to write the critique if only to set people straight.\
(I'm sorry; I love setting people straight.)
