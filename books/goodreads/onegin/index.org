* Eugene Onegin 🔫

*Encyclopedia of life.*

You and I can take comfortable seats, each armed with a cup of tea and start
talking about Eugene Onegin. We would grow old together in those chairs, with
tea evaporated, and the cup withered away—still, we would only be touching the
very surface of Pushkin's magnum opus.
