I love science fiction. Unfortunately, many of contemporary sci-fi works focus
too heavily on some other-worldly tech, massive star energy collectors, colossal
ships, etc. The science fiction that I grew up with, as in the works of Isaac
Asimov, Alexander Belyaev, Stanislaw Lem, etc., which all primarily focused on
people and treated science as a sociological catalyst.

Who could top any pre-defined expectations and status quo but Asimov himself?
All with alien sex and the premise, which is almost impossible to wrap your head
around. Imagining a whole new universe, where the fundamental laws of physics
are so different from ours that the troubles of animating something like this
warranted a whole separate story, /Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection/.

As a few fellow reviewers/commenters noted here—it's not necessarily a work that
I would come back to reading, but the one I deeply respect.
