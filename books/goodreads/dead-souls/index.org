I cried laughing from beginning till the bitter end. No one is sharper with
satire than Gogol. However, unfortunately, he does lack the ability to write
philosophy—the digressions and pondering onto the Russian soul and the state of
affairs of the nation do fall flat and get unbelievably boring, especially when
they are sandwiched between what no one can even come close to
replicating—Gogol's satire.

Dead Souls is the story of Russia. Specifically, the Hell of Russia. A Dante and
Divine Comedy level of work, which forever imprinted itself as one of the
foundational works in all of Russian Literature.
