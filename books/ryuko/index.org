* Ryuko üêâ

358; 12022 H.E.

I just finished the two volumes of /Ryuko/ by Eldo Yoshimizu. Before going
in-depth into why this might be one of my all-time favorite crime fiction
stories (and stylish mangas), I have to say,

#+begin_center
*It is violently brilliant.*

A confession must be made -- I have never heard of /Ryuko/ or Eldo Yoshimizu
before. Knowing that I adore /Kill Bill/, my close friend saw the /Ryuko/ collection
at Barnes & Noble and recommended it. Now, I feel like I have been missing out
on scratching the itch that had me bothered for years.

On the surface, /Ryuko/ is a Japanese crime epic, full of international intrigue,
complex relationships, and an explosion of what I consider to be one of the most
unique and soul-trembling art styles I have had the pleasure of witnessing. As a
comment says on the back of the book,

What I adore, /Ryuko/ is all that and much more. From my
reading it, I picked up a solid story of a mother-father-daughter relationship,
the Cardinal Sin of father killing, and an exploration of morality between
them. 

Throughout the read, Mr. Yoshimizu masterfully switches between fast and wild
scenes; every page is a mini-work of art to serene moments where the world seems
to have stopped. Still, I want every frame and page drawn in full scale on a
wall somewhere in my apartment.

Here are some pages retrieved from Eldo Yoshimizu's [[https://twitter.com/ryukoyoshimizu][official Twitter]],

I do not know what it is about the style and class, but whenever I go and
re-read the pages, I feel as if my brain is being hacked in real time. The
composure of all the elements, combined with the story of complicated betrayal
and forgiveness, cast a spell. They put me in a trance, where I am lost in the
world of /Ryuko/.

One of the critical advantages that Mr. Yoshimizu employed is how the plot
stays unapologetically no-nonsense from beginning till the end. None of the
characters, plotlines, twists, and knobs overstay their welcome. On the
contrary, I want more, yet I immediately realize I need to restrain myself for
my own good.

Some works leave you empty, and some leave you frustrated, hungry, or feeling
like you took a dive into a dumpster. However, this one -- /Ryuko/ leaves a sweet
yet pleasantly bitter aftertaste. It is a sign that it was /clean/ and knew what
it was, what it had to be; finally, most of all -- it did exactly that. Anton
Chekhov famously said,

#+begin_quote
/``Brevity is the sister of talent.''/
#+end_quote

Going off of that, I do not wish to overstay my welcome either or mull over the
same thoughts repeatedly. If any of the above intrigues you, go and find /Ryuko/
in your local bookstores or grab the whole boxed set (all two volumes) at [[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ryuko-vol-1-2-boxed-set-eldo-yoshimizu/1138741914][Barnes
& Noble]]. Here is the bundle they can get you (with cards!)

Absolutely go and check out [[https://www.eldoyoshimizu.com/][Eldo Yoshimizu's website]] and his
[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyCqfuPSXNPkDpsJ0MEqdg][YouTube channel]]. Speaking of his YouTube channel, he uploaded an animated,
jazzy soundtrack accompanied video (what I think is a trailer) with excerpts
from /Ryuko/. I will link the video below with some extra art pieces taken from
Mr. Yoshimizu's website and Twitter.
